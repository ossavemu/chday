  "Matthew": [
    "1. This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: 2.  3.  4.  5.  6. Next: 7.  8.  9.  10.  11.  12. After the exile to Babylon: 13.  14.  15.  16.  17. In all, then, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ. 18. This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. 19. Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly. 20. But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21. She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.” 22. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 23.  24. When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and embraced Mary as his wife. 25. But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a Son. And he gave Him the name Jesus.",
    "1. After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, 2. asking, “Where is the One who has been born King of the Jews? We saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.” 3. When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 4. And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born. 5. “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written: 6.  7. Then Herod called the Magi secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared. 8. And sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and search carefully for the Child, and when you find Him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship Him.” 9. After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the Child was. 10. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great delight. 11. On coming to the house, they saw the Child with His mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh. 12. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route. 13. When the Magi had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him.” 14. So he got up, took the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt, 15. where he stayed until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called My Son.” 16. When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was filled with rage. Sending orders, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi. 17. Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: 18.  19. After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt. 20. “Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel, for those seeking the Child’s life are now dead.” 21. So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and went to the land of Israel. 22. But when he learned that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, 23. and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”",
    "1. In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea 2. and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” 3. This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: 4. John wore a garment of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 5. People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region around the Jordan. 6. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 7. But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8. Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. 9. And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 10. The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 11. I baptize you with water for repentance, but after me will come One more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 12. His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 13. At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. 14. But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?” 15. “Let it be so now,” Jesus replied. “It is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness in this way.” Then John permitted Him. 16. As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him. 17. And a voice from heaven said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!”",
    "1. Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 2. After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry. 3. The tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” 4. But Jesus answered, “It is written: 5. Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple. 6. “If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written: 7. Jesus replied, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ” 8. Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 9. “All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall down and worship me.” 10. “Away from Me, Satan!” Jesus declared. “For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’ ” 11. Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him. 12. When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He withdrew to Galilee. 13. Leaving Nazareth, He went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, 14. to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 15.  16.  17. From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” 18. As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 19. “Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” 20. And at once they left their nets and followed Him. 21. Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them, 22. and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him. 23. Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. 24. News about Him spread all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed—and He healed them. 25. The large crowds that followed Him came from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.",
    "1. When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to Him, 2. and He began to teach them, saying: 3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.  9.  10.  11. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you. 13. You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its savor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. 14. You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. 15. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they set it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. 17. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. 18. For I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19. So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20. For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 21. You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder’ and ‘Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ 22. But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca,’ will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the fire of hell. 23. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24. leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift. 25. Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 26. Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. 27. You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ 28. But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29. If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to depart into hell. 31. It has also been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’ 32. But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, brings adultery upon her. And he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 33. Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.’ 34. But I tell you not to swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35. or by the earth, for it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36. Nor should you swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37. Simply let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ Anything more comes from the evil one. 38. You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’ 39. But I tell you not to resist an evil person. If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also; 40. if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well; 41. and if someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. 42. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. 43. You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘Hate your enemy.’ 44. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45. that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even tax collectors do the same? 47. And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even Gentiles do the same? 48. Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.",
    "1. “Be careful not to perform your righteous acts before men to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. 2. So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. 3. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4. so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 5. And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. 6. But when you pray, go into your inner room, shut your door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7. And when you pray, do not babble on like pagans, for they think that by their many words they will be heard. 8. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. 9. So then, this is how you should pray: 10.  11.  12.  13.  14. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive yours. 16. When you fast, do not be somber like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. 17. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 18. so that your fasting will not be obvious to men, but only to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 19. Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 22. The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. 23. But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! 24. No one can serve two masters: Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. 25. Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26. Look at the birds of the air: They do not sow or reap or gather into barns—and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27. Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? 28. And why do you worry about clothes? Consider how the lilies of the field grow: They do not labor or spin. 29. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these. 30. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 31. Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32. For the Gentiles strive after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you. 34. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.",
    "1. “Do not judge, or you will be judged. 2. For with the same judgment you pronounce, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. 3. Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye? 4. How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while there is still a beam in your own eye? 5. You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye. 6. Do not give dogs what is holy; do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces. 7. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. 8. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. 9. Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10. Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 11. So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! 12. In everything, then, do to others as you would have them do to you. For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets. 13. Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14. But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it. 15. Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16. By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17. Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20. So then, by their fruit you will recognize them. 21. Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 22. Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ 23. Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’ 24. Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25. The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock. 26. But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27. The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its collapse!” 28. When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were astonished at His teaching, 29. because He taught as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.",
    "1. When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him. 2. Suddenly a leper came and knelt before Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” 3. Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 4. Then Jesus instructed him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift prescribed by Moses, as a testimony to them.” 5. When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came and pleaded with Him, 6. “Lord, my servant lies at home, paralyzed and in terrible agony.” 7. “I will go and heal him,” Jesus replied. 8. The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.” 10. When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those following Him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. 11. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 12. But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 13. Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you have believed, so will it be done for you.” And his servant was healed at that very hour. 14. When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law sick in bed with a fever. 15. So He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve them. 16. When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. 17. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 18. When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him, He gave orders to cross to the other side of the sea. 19. And one of the scribes came to Him and said, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.” 20. Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.” 21. Another of His disciples requested, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” 22. But Jesus told him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.” 23. When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. 24. Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was engulfed by the waves; but Jesus was sleeping. 25. The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” 26. “You of little faith,” Jesus replied, “why are you so afraid?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was perfectly calm. 27. The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!” 28. When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, He was met by two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. 29. “What do You want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have You come here to torture us before the appointed time?” 30. In the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding. 31. So the demons begged Jesus, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” 32. “Go!” He told them. So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the waters. 33. Those tending the pigs ran off into the town and reported all this, including the account of the demon-possessed men. 34. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.",
    "1. Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own town. 2. Just then some men brought to Him a paralytic lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.” 3. On seeing this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” 4. But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Why do you harbor evil in your hearts? 5. Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’ 6. But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” Then He said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your mat, and go home.” 7. And the man got up and went home. 8. When the crowds saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. 9. As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, and Matthew got up and followed Him. 10. Later, as Jesus was dining at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Him and His disciples. 11. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 12. On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 13. But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners. ” 14. At that time John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast so often, but Your disciples do not fast?” 15. Jesus replied, “How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while He is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. 16. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result. 17. Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.” 18. While Jesus was saying these things, a synagogue leader came and knelt before Him. “My daughter has just died,” he said. “But come and place Your hand on her, and she will live.” 19. So Jesus got up and went with him, along with His disciples. 20. Suddenly a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak. 21. She said to herself, “If only I touch His cloak, I will be healed.” 22. Jesus turned and saw her. “Take courage, daughter,” He said, “your faith has healed you.” And the woman was cured from that very hour. 23. When Jesus entered the house of the synagogue leader, He saw the flute players and the noisy crowd. 24. “Go away,” He told them. “The girl is not dead, but asleep.” And they laughed at Him. 25. After the crowd had been put outside, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. 26. And the news about this spread throughout that region. 27. As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” 28. After Jesus had entered the house, the blind men came to Him. “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” He asked. “Yes, Lord,” they answered. 29. Then He touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith will it be done to you.” 30. And their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them sternly, “See that no one finds out about this!” 31. But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout the land. 32. As they were leaving, a demon-possessed man who was mute was brought to Jesus. 33. And when the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!” 34. But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that He drives out demons.” 35. Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness. 36. When He saw the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 37. Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. 38. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.”",
    "1. And calling His twelve disciples to Him, Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and sickness. 2. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; 3. Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 4. Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. 5. These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. 6. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. 7. As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’ 8. Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. 9. Do not carry any gold or silver or copper in your belts. 10. Take no bag for the road, or second tunic, or sandals, or staff; for the worker is worthy of his provisions. 11. Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house until you move on. 12. As you enter the home, greet its occupants. 13. If the home is worthy, let your peace rest on it; but if it is not, let your peace return to you. 14. And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. 15. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. 16. Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. 17. But beware of men; for they will hand you over to their councils and flog you in their synagogues. 18. On My account, you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. 19. But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to say. 20. For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. 21. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death. 22. You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. 23. When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. 24. A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. 25. It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! 26. So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. 27. What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops. 28. Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. 29. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. 30. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31. So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 32. Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in heaven. 33. But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven. 34. Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35. For I have come to turn 36.  37. Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me; 38. and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me. 39. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. 40. He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me. 41. Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward. 42. And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.”",
    "1. After Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their cities. 2. Meanwhile John heard in prison about the works of Christ, and he sent his disciples 3. to ask Him, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?” 4. Jesus replied, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see: 5. The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. 6. Blessed is the one who does not fall away on account of Me. ” 7. As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind? 8. Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothing are found in kings’ palaces. 9. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 10. This is the one about whom it is written: 11. Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subject to violence, and the violent lay claim to it. 13. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. 14. And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. 15. He who has ears, let him hear. 16. To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: 17.  18. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’ 19. The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her actions.” 20. Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. 21. “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. 23. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. 24. But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.” 25. At that time Jesus declared, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. 26. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight. 27. All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. 28. Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”",
    "1. At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat them. 2. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.” 3. Jesus replied, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 4. He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, but only for the priests. 5. Or haven’t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and yet are innocent? 6. But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. 7. If only you had known the meaning of ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent. 8. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” 9. Moving on from there, Jesus entered their synagogue, 10. and a man with a withered hand was there. In order to accuse Jesus, they asked Him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” 11. He replied, “If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out? 12. How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” 13. Then Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and it was restored to full use, just like the other. 14. But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. 15. Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them all, 16. warning them not to make Him known. 17. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 18.  19.  20.  21.  22. Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed the man so that he could speak and see. 23. The crowds were astounded and asked, “Could this be the Son of David?” 24. But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “Only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, does this man drive out demons.” 25. Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. 26. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? 27. And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. 28. But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 29. Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and steal his possessions, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. 30. He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. 31. Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 32. Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the one to come. 33. Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad; for a tree is known by its fruit. 34. You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks. 35. The good man brings good things out of his good store of treasure, and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil store of treasure. 36. But I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken. 37. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.” 38. Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.” 39. Jesus replied, “A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41. The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here. 42. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here. 43. When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. 44. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ On its return, it finds the house vacant, swept clean, and put in order. 45. Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and dwell there; and the final plight of that man is worse than the first. So will it be with this wicked generation.” 46. While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, His mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to Him. 47. Someone told Him, “Look, Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to You.” 48. But Jesus replied, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?” 49. Pointing to His disciples, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers. 50. For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”",
    "1. That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea. 2. Such large crowds gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore. 3. And He told them many things in parables, saying, “A farmer went out to sow his seed. 4. And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. 5. Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. 6. But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings. 8. Still other seed fell on good soil and produced a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold. 9. He who has ears, let him hear.” 10. Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do You speak to the people in parables?” 11. He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. 12. Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 13. This is why I speak to them in parables: 14. In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: 15.  16. But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. 17. For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. 18. Consider, then, the parable of the sower: 19. When anyone hears the message of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. 20. The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. 21. But since he has no root, he remains for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. 22. The seed sown among the thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 23. But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and produces a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.” 24. Jesus put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25. But while everyone was asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and slipped away. 26. When the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds also appeared. 27. The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ 28. ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. So the servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’ 29. ‘No,’ he said, ‘if you pull the weeds now, you might uproot the wheat with them. 30. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat into my barn.’” 31. He put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field. 32. Although it is the smallest of all seeds, yet it grows into the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.” 33. He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.” 34. Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable. 35. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: 36. Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” 37. He replied, “The One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. 38. The field is the world, and the good seed represents the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, 39. and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. 40. As the weeds are collected and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age. 41. The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness. 42. And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 43. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. 44. The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought that field. 45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. 46. When he found one very precious pearl, he went away and sold all he had and bought it. 47. Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and caught all kinds of fish. 48. When it was full, the men pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw the bad away. 49. So will it be at the end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous, 50. and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 51. Have you understood all these things?” “Yes,” they answered. 52. Then He told them, “For this reason, every scribe who has been discipled in the kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.” 53. When Jesus had finished these parables, He withdrew from that place. 54. Coming to His hometown, He taught the people in their synagogue, and they were astonished. “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?” they asked. 55. “Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t His mother’s name Mary, and aren’t His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? 56. Aren’t all His sisters with us as well? Where then did this man get all these things?” 57. And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, “Only in his hometown and in his own household is a prophet without honor.” 58. And He did not do many miracles there, because of their unbelief.",
    "1. At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus 2. and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.” 3. Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, 4. because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” 5. Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a prophet. 6. On Herod’s birthday, however, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod 7. so much that he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she asked. 8. Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” 9. The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted 10. and sent to have John beheaded in the prison. 11. John’s head was brought in on a platter and presented to the girl, who carried it to her mother. 12. Then John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. And they went and informed Jesus. 13. When Jesus heard about John, He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. But the crowds found out about it and followed Him on foot from the towns. 14. When He stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them and healed their sick. 15. When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.” 16. “They do not need to go away,” Jesus replied. “You give them something to eat.” 17. “We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered. 18. “Bring them here to Me,” Jesus said. 19. And He directed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 20. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 21. About five thousand men were fed, in addition to women and children. 22. Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds. 23. After He had sent them away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone, 24. but the boat was already far from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. 25. During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. 26. When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear. 27. But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.” 28. “Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied, “command me to come to You on the water.” 29. “Come,” said Jesus. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. 30. But when he saw the strength of the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” 31. Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of Peter. “You of little faith,” He said, “why did you doubt?” 32. And when they had climbed back into the boat, the wind died down. 33. Then those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!” 34. When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. 35. And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding region. People brought all the sick to Him 36. and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.",
    "1. Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, 2. “Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.” 3. Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? 4. For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ 5. But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’ 6. he need not honor his father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. 7. You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you: 8.  9.  10. Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “Listen and understand. 11. A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.” 12. Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?” 13. But Jesus replied, “Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by its roots. 14. Disregard them! They are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” 15. Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.” 16. “Do you still not understand?” Jesus asked. 17. “Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated? 18. But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man. 19. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander. 20. These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.” 21. Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. 22. And a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.” 23. But Jesus did not answer a word. So His disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.” 24. He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” 25. The woman came and knelt before Him. “Lord, help me!” she said. 26. But Jesus replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.” 27. “Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” 28. “O woman,” Jesus answered, “your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour. 29. Moving on from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down. 30. Large crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them. 31. The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. 32. Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.” 33. The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?” 34. “How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.” 35. And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. 36. Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 37. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 38. A total of four thousand men were fed, in addition to women and children. 39. After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.",
    "1. Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came and tested Jesus by asking Him to show them a sign from heaven. 2. But He replied, “When evening comes, you say, ‘The weather will be fair, for the sky is red,’ 3. and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but not the signs of the times. 4. A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.” Then He left them and went away. 5. When they crossed to the other side, the disciples forgot to take bread. 6. “Watch out!” Jesus told them. “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” 7. They discussed this among themselves and concluded, “It is because we did not bring any bread.” 8. Aware of their conversation, Jesus said, “You of little faith, why are you debating among yourselves about having no bread? 9. Do you still not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 10. Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 11. How do you not understand that I was not telling you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” 12. Then they understood that He was not telling them to beware of the leaven used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 13. When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He questioned His disciples: “Who do people say the Son of Man is?” 14. They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 15. “But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?” 16. Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 17. Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by My Father in heaven. 18. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. 19. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” 20. Then He admonished the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ. 21. From that time on Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. 22. Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. “Far be it from You, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to You!” 23. But Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.” 24. Then Jesus told His disciples, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. 25. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. 26. What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? 27. For the Son of Man will come in His Father’s glory with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to what he has done. 28. Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”",
    "1. After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. 2. There He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. 3. Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them, talking with Jesus. 4. Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, I will put up three shelters —one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 5. While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!” 6. When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown in terror. 7. Then Jesus came over and touched them. “Get up,” He said. “Do not be afraid.” 8. And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus. 9. As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Do not tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.” 10. The disciples asked Him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 11. Jesus replied, “Elijah does indeed come, and he will restore all things. 12. But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.” 13. Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Baptist. 14. When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus and knelt before Him. 15. “Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. 16. I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not heal him.” 17. “O unbelieving and perverse generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.” 18. Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment. 19. Afterward the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” 20. “Because you have so little faith,” He answered. “For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.” 22. When they gathered together in Galilee, Jesus told them, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men. 23. They will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised to life.” And the disciples were deeply grieved. 24. After they had arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and asked, “Does your Teacher pay the two drachmas?” 25. “Yes,” he answered. When Peter entered the house, Jesus preempted him. “What do you think, Simon?” He asked. “From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs and taxes: from their own sons, or from others?” 26. “From others,” Peter answered. “Then the sons are exempt,” Jesus declared. 27. “But so that we may not offend them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for My tax and yours.”",
    "1. At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 2. Jesus invited a little child to stand among them. 3. “Truly I tell you,” He said, “unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 4. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5. And whoever welcomes a little child like this in My name welcomes Me. 6. But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. 7. Woe to the world for the causes of sin. These stumbling blocks must come, but woe to the man through whom they come! 8. If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. 9. And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. 10. See that you do not look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of My Father in heaven. 12. What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go out to search for the one that is lost? 13. And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. 14. In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish. 15. If your brother sins against you, go and confront him privately. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. 16. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’ 17. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, regard him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. 18. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. 19. Again, I tell you truly that if two of you on the earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by My Father in heaven. 20. For where two or three gather together in My name, there am I with them.” 21. Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother who sins against me? Up to seven times?” 22. Jesus answered, “I tell you, not just seven times, but seventy-seven times! 23. Because of this, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 24. As he began the settlements, a debtor was brought to him owing ten thousand talents. 25. Since the man was unable to pay, the master ordered that he be sold to pay his debt, along with his wife and children and everything he owned. 26. Then the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Have patience with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’ 27. His master had compassion on him, forgave his debt, and released him. 28. But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ 29. So his fellow servant fell down and begged him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.’ 30. But he refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay his debt. 31. When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and recounted all of this to their master. 32. Then the master summoned him and declared, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave all your debt because you begged me. 33. Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had on you?’ 34. In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should repay all that he owed. 35. That is how My heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.”",
    "1. When Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. 2. Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there. 3. Then some Pharisees came and tested Him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?” 4. Jesus answered, “Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ 5. and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’ ? 6. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.” 7. “Why then,” they asked, “did Moses order a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away? ” 8. Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart; but it was not this way from the beginning. 9. Now I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman, commits adultery. ” 10. His disciples said to Him, “If this is the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.” 11. “Not everyone can accept this word,” He replied, “but only those to whom it has been given. 12. For there are eunuchs who were born that way; others were made that way by men; and still others live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.” 13. Then the little children were brought to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them and pray for them. And the disciples rebuked those who brought them. 14. But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” 15. And after He had placed His hands on them, He went on from there. 16. Just then a man came up to Jesus and inquired, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?” 17. “Why do you ask Me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.” 18. “Which ones?” the man asked. Jesus answered, “‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, 19. honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.’ ” 20. “All these I have kept,” said the young man. “What do I still lack?” 21. Jesus told him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.” 22. When the young man heard this, he went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth. 23. Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 25. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?” 26. Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” 27. “Look,” Peter replied, “we have left everything to follow You. What then will there be for us?” 28. Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, in the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for the sake of My name will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. 30. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.",
    "1. “For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 2. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. 3. About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. 4. ‘You also go into my vineyard,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you whatever is right.’ 5. So they went. He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. 6. About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’ he asked. 7. ‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. So he told them, ‘You also go into my vineyard.’ 8. When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and moving on to the first.’ 9. The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. 10. So when the original workers came, they assumed they would receive more. But each of them also received a denarius. 11. On receiving their pay, they began to grumble against the landowner. 12. ‘These men who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.’ 13. But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Did you not agree with me on one denarius? 14. Take your pay and go. I want to give this last man the same as I gave you. 15. Do I not have the right to do as I please with what is mine? Or are you envious because I am generous?’ 16. So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” 17. As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside and said, 18. “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn Him to death 19. and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. And on the third day He will be raised to life.” 20. Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and knelt down to make a request of Him. 21. “What do you want?” He inquired. She answered, “Declare that in Your kingdom one of these two sons of mine may sit at Your right hand, and the other at Your left.” 22. “You do not know what you are asking,” Jesus replied. “Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?” “We can,” the brothers answered. 23. “You will indeed drink My cup,” Jesus said. “But to sit at My right or left is not Mine to grant. These seats belong to those for whom My Father has prepared them.” 24. When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. 25. But Jesus called them aside and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority over them. 26. It shall not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 27. and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave— 28. just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” 29. As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. 30. And there were two blind men sitting beside the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!” 31. The crowd admonished them to be silent, but they cried out all the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!” 32. Jesus stopped and called them. “What do you want Me to do for you?” He asked. 33. “Lord,” they answered, “let our eyes be opened.” 34. Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and at once they received their sight and followed Him.",
    "1. As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two disciples, 2. saying to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to Me. 3. If anyone questions you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.” 4. This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: 5.  6. So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. 7. They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. 8. A massive crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 9. The crowds that went ahead of Him and those that followed were shouting: 10. When Jesus had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?” 11. The crowds replied, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” 12. Then Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves. 13. And He declared to them, “It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer.’ But you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’ ” 14. The blind and the lame came to Him at the temple, and He healed them. 15. But the chief priests and scribes were indignant when they saw the wonders He performed and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” 16. “Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked. “Yes,” Jesus answered. “Have you never read: 17. Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where He spent the night. 18. In the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, He was hungry. 19. Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. “May you never bear fruit again!” He said. And immediately the tree withered. 20. When the disciples saw this, they marveled and asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” 21. “Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen. 22. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.” 23. When Jesus returned to the temple courts and began to teach, the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him. “By what authority are You doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave You this authority?” 24. “I will also ask you one question,” Jesus replied, “and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 25. What was the source of John’s baptism? Was it from heaven or from men?” They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 26. But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the people, for they all regard John as a prophet.” 27. So they answered, “We do not know.” And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 28. But what do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first one and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’ 29. ‘I will not,’ he replied. But later he changed his mind and went. 30. Then the man went to the second son and told him the same thing. ‘I will, sir,’ he said. But he did not go. 31. Which of the two did the will of his father?” “The first, ” they answered. Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you. 32. For John came to you in a righteous way and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. 33. Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey. 34. When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit. 35. But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. 36. Again, he sent other servants, more than the first group. But the tenants did the same to them. 37. Finally, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. 38. But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance.’ 39. So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40. Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?” 41. “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and will rent out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the fruit at harvest time.” 42. Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: 43. Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. 44. He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed. ” 45. When the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they knew that Jesus was speaking about them. 46. Although they wanted to arrest Him, they were afraid of the crowds, because the people regarded Him as a prophet.",
    "1. Once again, Jesus spoke to them in parables: 2. “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3. He sent his servants to call those he had invited to the banquet, but they refused to come. 4. Again, he sent other servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’ 5. But they paid no attention and went away, one to his field, another to his business. 6. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them. 7. The king was enraged, and he sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn their city. 8. Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited were not worthy. 9. Go therefore to the crossroads and invite to the banquet as many as you can find.’ 10. So the servants went out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find, both evil and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11. But when the king came in to see the guests, he spotted a man who was not dressed in wedding clothes. 12. ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the man was speechless. 13. Then the king told the servants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 14. For many are called, but few are chosen.” 15. Then the Pharisees went out and conspired to trap Jesus in His words. 16. They sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are honest and that You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You seek favor from no one, because You pay no attention to external appearance. 17. So tell us what You think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” 18. But Jesus knew their evil intent and said, “You hypocrites, why are you testing Me? 19. Show Me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought Him a denarius. 20. “Whose image is this,” He asked, “and whose inscription?” 21. “Caesar’s,” they answered. So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” 22. And when they heard this, they were amazed. So they left Him and went away. 23. That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him. 24. “Teacher,” they said, “Moses declared that if a man dies without having children, his brother is to marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. 25. Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died without having children. So he left his wife to his brother. 26. The same thing happened to the second and third brothers, down to the seventh. 27. And last of all, the woman died. 28. In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For all of them were married to her.” 29. Jesus answered, “You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. 30. In the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven. 31. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said to you: 32. ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’ ? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.” 33. When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching. 34. And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they themselves gathered together. 35. One of them, an expert in the law, tested Him with a question: 36. “Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?” 37. Jesus declared, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ 38. This is the first and greatest commandment. 39. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” 41. While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus questioned them: 42. “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?” “David’s,” they answered. 43. Jesus said to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord’? For he says: 44.  45. So if David calls Him ‘Lord,’ how can He be David’s son?” 46. No one was able to answer a word, and from that day on no one dared to question Him any further.",
    "1. Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples: 2. “The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. 3. So practice and observe everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. 4. They tie up heavy, burdensome loads and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. 5. All their deeds are done for men to see. They broaden their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels. 6. They love the places of honor at banquets, the chief seats in the synagogues, 7. the greetings in the marketplaces, and the title of ‘Rabbi’ by which they are addressed. 8. But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. 9. And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. 10. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Christ. 11. The greatest among you shall be your servant. 12. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. 13. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let in those who wish to enter. 15. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You traverse land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. 16. Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.’ 17. You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes it sacred? 18. And you say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.’ 19. You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes it sacred? 20. So then, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. 21. And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the One who dwells in it. 22. And he who swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and by the One who sits on it. 23. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You pay tithes of mint, dill, and cumin. But you have disregarded the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. 24. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. 25. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 26. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside may become clean as well. 27. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside, but on the inside are full of dead men’s bones and every kind of impurity. 28. In the same way, on the outside you appear to be righteous, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. 29. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous. 30. And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ 31. So you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets. 32. Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your fathers. 33. You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape the sentence of hell? 34. Because of this, I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and others you will flog in your synagogues and persecute in town after town. 35. And so upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 36. Truly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation. 37. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling! 38. Look, your house is left to you desolate. 39. For I tell you that you will not see Me again until you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’ ”",
    "1. As Jesus left the temple and was walking away, His disciples came up to Him to point out its buildings. 2. “Do you see all these things?” He replied. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.” 3. While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?” 4. Jesus answered, “See to it that no one deceives you. 5. For many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many. 6. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8. All these are the beginning of birth pains. 9. Then they will deliver you over to be persecuted and killed, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. 10. At that time many will fall away and will betray and hate one another, 11. and many false prophets will arise and mislead many. 12. Because of the multiplication of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold. 13. But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. 14. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. 15. So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination of desolation,’ described by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand), 16. then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17. Let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve anything from his house. 18. And let no one in the field return for his cloak. 19. How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! 20. Pray that your flight will not occur in the winter or on the Sabbath. 21. For at that time there will be great tribulation, unmatched from the beginning of the world until now, and never to be seen again. 22. If those days had not been cut short, nobody would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be cut short. 23. At that time, if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There He is!’ do not believe it. 24. For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders that would deceive even the elect, if that were possible. 25. See, I have told you in advance. 26. So if they tell you, ‘There He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. 27. For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. 29. Immediately after the tribulation of those days: 30. At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31. And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. 32. Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near. 33. So also, when you see all these things, you will know that He is near, right at the door. 34. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened. 35. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. 36. No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 37. As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark. 39. And they were oblivious, until the flood came and swept them all away. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. 40. Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. 41. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. 42. Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day on which your Lord will come. 43. But understand this: If the homeowner had known in which watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. 44. For this reason, you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect. 45. Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of his household, to give the others their food at the proper time? 46. Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. 47. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 48. But suppose that servant is wicked and says in his heart, ‘My master will be away a long time.’ 49. And he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. 50. The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate. 51. Then he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
    "1. “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 3. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take along any extra oil. 4. But the wise ones took oil in flasks along with their lamps. 5. When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. 6. At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’ 7. Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8. The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’ 9. ‘No,’ said the wise ones, ‘or there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ 10. But while they were on their way to buy it, the bridegroom arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet, and the door was shut. 11. Later the other virgins arrived and said, ‘Lord, lord, open the door for us!’ 12. But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I do not know you.’ 13. Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour. 14. For it is just like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted them with his possessions. 15. To one he gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another one talent—each according to his own ability. And he went on his journey. 16. The servant who had received the five talents went at once and put them to work and gained five more. 17. Likewise, the one with the two talents gained two more. 18. But the servant who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money. 19. After a long time the master of those servants returned to settle accounts with them. 20. The servant who had received the five talents came and presented five more. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’ 21. His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’ 22. The servant who had received the two talents also came and said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with two talents. See, I have gained two more.’ 23. His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’ 24. Finally, the servant who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Master, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25. So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what belongs to you.’ 26. ‘You wicked, lazy servant!’ replied his master. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed. 27. Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received it back with interest. 28. Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents. 29. For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 30. And throw that worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 31. When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne. 32. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33. He will place the sheep on His right and the goats on His left. 34. Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35. For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in, 36. I was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you looked after Me, I was in prison and you visited Me.’ 37. Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to drink? 38. When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? 39. When did we see You sick or in prison and visit You?’ 40. And the King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.’ 41. Then He will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42. For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, 43. I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’ 44. And they too will reply, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’ 45. Then the King will answer, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.’ 46. And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”",
    "1. When Jesus had finished saying all these things, He told His disciples, 2. “You know that the Passover is two days away, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.” 3. At that time the chief priests and elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, 4. and they conspired to arrest Jesus covertly and kill Him. 5. “But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.” 6. While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper, 7. a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, which she poured on His head as He reclined at the table. 8. When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and asked, “Why this waste? 9. This perfume could have been sold at a high price, and the money given to the poor.” 10. Aware of this, Jesus asked, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful deed to Me. 11. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me. 12. By pouring this perfume on Me, she has prepared My body for burial. 13. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.” 14. Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15. and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” And they set out for him thirty pieces of silver. 16. So from then on Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus. 17. On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?” 18. He answered, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him that the Teacher says, ‘My time is near. I will keep the Passover with My disciples at your house.’” 19. So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. 20. When evening came, Jesus was reclining with the twelve disciples. 21. And while they were eating, He said to them, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray Me.” 22. They were deeply grieved and began to ask Him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?” 23. Jesus answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with Me will betray Me. 24. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed. It would be better for him if he had not been born.” 25. Then Judas, who would betray Him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “You have said it yourself.” 26. While they were eating, Jesus took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is My body.” 27. Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. 28. This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29. I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in My Father’s kingdom.” 30. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 31. Then Jesus said to them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of Me. For it is written: 32. But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 33. Peter said to Him, “Even if all fall away on account of You, I never will.” 34. “Truly I tell you,” Jesus declared, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” 35. Peter replied, “Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the other disciples said the same thing. 36. At that time Jesus went with His disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and He told them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” 37. He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. 38. Then He said to them, “My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.” 39. Going a little farther, He fell facedown and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will.” 40. Then Jesus returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. “Were you not able to keep watch with Me for one hour?” He asked Peter. 41. “Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” 42. A second time He went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may Your will be done.” 43. And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping—for their eyes were heavy. 44. So He left them and went away once more and prayed a third time, saying the same thing. 45. Then He returned to the disciples and said, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46. Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer is approaching!” 47. While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him.” 49. Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him. 50. “Friend,” Jesus replied, “do what you came for.” Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested Him. 51. At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. 52. “Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him. “For all who draw the sword will die by the sword. 53. Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels? 54. But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?” 55. At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw? Every day I sat teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest Me. 56. But this has all happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled. 57. Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had gathered. 58. But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. 59. Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death. 60. But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward 61. and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’” 62. So the high priest stood up and asked Him, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?” 63. But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.” 64. “You have said it yourself,” Jesus answered. “But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” 65. At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. 66. What do you think?” “He deserves to die,” they answered. 67. Then they spit in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him 68. and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?” 69. Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with Jesus the Galilean,” she said. 70. But he denied it before them all: “I do not know what you are talking about.” 71. When Peter had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.” 72. And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!” 73. After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said, “for your accent gives you away.” 74. At that he began to curse and swear to them, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed. 75. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.",
    "1. When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put Him to death. 2. They bound Him, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate the governor. 3. When Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was filled with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders. 4. “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,” he said. “What is that to us?” they replied. “You bear the responsibility.” 5. So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. 6. The chief priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is unlawful to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.” 7. After conferring together, they used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. 8. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 9. Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: 10.  11. Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned Him: “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied. 12. And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He gave no answer. 13. Then Pilate asked Him, “Do You not hear how many charges they are bringing against You?” 14. But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge, much to the governor’s amazement. 15. Now it was the governor’s custom at the feast to release to the crowd a prisoner of their choosing. 16. At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas. 17. So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” 18. For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. 19. While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of Him.” 20. But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death. 21. “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. “Barabbas,” they replied. 22. “What then should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify Him!” 23. “Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!” 24. When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that instead a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood, ” he said. “You bear the responsibility.” 25. All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!” 26. So Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified. 27. Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company around Him. 28. They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. 29. And they twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on His head. They put a staff in His right hand and knelt down before Him to mock Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 30. Then they spit on Him and took the staff and struck Him on the head repeatedly. 31. After they had mocked Him, they removed the robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him away to crucify Him. 32. Along the way they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross of Jesus. 33. And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull, 34. they offered Him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it. 35. When they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments by casting lots. 36. And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there. 37. Above His head they posted the written charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 38. Two robbers were crucified with Him, one on His right hand and the other on His left. 39. And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads 40. and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!” 41. In the same way, the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked Him, saying, 42. “He saved others, but He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him. 43. He trusts in God. Let God deliver Him now if He wants Him. For He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” 44. In the same way, even the robbers who were crucified with Him berated Him. 45. From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. 46. About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” 47. When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He is calling Elijah.” 48. One of them quickly ran and brought a sponge. He filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and held it up for Jesus to drink. 49. But the others said, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him.” 50. When Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, He yielded up His spirit. 51. At that moment the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. 52. The tombs broke open, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. 53. After Jesus’ resurrection, when they had come out of the tombs, they entered the holy city and appeared to many people. 54. When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this was the Son of God.” 55. And many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to Him. 56. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. 57. When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself was a disciple of Jesus. 58. He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. 59. So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 60. and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance to the tomb and went away. 61. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. 62. The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and Pharisees assembled before Pilate. 63. “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while He was alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ 64. So give the order that the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him away and tell the people He has risen from the dead. And this last deception would be worse than the first.” 65. “You have a guard,” Pilate said. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” 66. So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard.",
    "1. After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 2. Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it. 3. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 4. The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men. 5. But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6. He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay. 7. Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.” 8. So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples. 9. Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him. 10. “Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.” 11. While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. 12. And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money 13. and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’ 14. If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” 15. So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day. 16. Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated. 17. When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted. 18. Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. 19. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, 20. and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”"

  "Mark": [
    "1. This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 2. As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: 3.  4. John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 5. People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 6. John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 7. And he began to proclaim: “After me will come One more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 8. I baptize you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ” 9. In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 10. As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, He saw the heavens breaking open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove. 11. And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.” 12. At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness, 13. and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him. 14. After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God. 15. “The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!” 16. As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 17. “Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” 18. And at once they left their nets and followed Him. 19. Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets. 20. Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him. 21. Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach. 22. The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. 23. Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue: 24. “What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” 25. But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!” 26. At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek. 27. All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!” 28. And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee. 29. As soon as Jesus and His companions had left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 30. Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her. 31. So He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them. 32. That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed, 33. and the whole town gathered at the door. 34. And He healed many who were ill with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was. 35. Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and slipped out to a solitary place to pray. 36. Simon and his companions went to look for Him, 37. and when they found Him, they said, “Everyone is looking for You!” 38. But Jesus answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for that is why I have come.” 39. So He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. 40. Then a leper came to Jesus, begging on his knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.” 41. Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” 42. And immediately the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed. 43. Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern warning: 44. “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” 45. But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.",
    "1. A few days later Jesus went back to Capernaum. And when the people heard that He was home, 2. they gathered in such large numbers that there was no more room, not even outside the door, as Jesus spoke the word to them. 3. Then a paralytic was brought to Him, carried by four men. 4. Since they were unable to get to Jesus through the crowd, they uncovered the roof above Him, made an opening, and lowered the paralytic on his mat. 5. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” 6. But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts, 7. “Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 8. At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves. “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?” He asked. 9. “Which is easier: to say to a paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’? 10. But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” He said to the paralytic, 11. “I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.” 12. And immediately the man got up, picked up his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!” 13. Once again Jesus went out beside the sea. All the people came to Him, and He taught them there. 14. As He was walking along, He saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, and Levi got up and followed Him. 15. While Jesus was dining at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His disciples—for there were many who followed Him. 16. When the scribes who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with these people, they asked His disciples, “Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 17. On hearing this, Jesus told them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” 18. Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were often fasting. So people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t Your disciples fast like John’s disciples and those of the Pharisees?” 19. Jesus replied, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them? As long as He is with them, they cannot fast. 20. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. 21. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and a worse tear will result. 22. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.” 23. One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain as they walked along. 24. So the Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” 25. Jesus replied, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? 26. During the high priesthood of Abiathar, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which was lawful only for the priests. And he gave some to his companions as well.” 27. Then Jesus declared, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 28. Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”",
    "1. Once again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. 2. In order to accuse Jesus, they were watching to see if He would heal on the Sabbath. 3. Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up among us.” 4. And He asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” But they were silent. 5. Jesus looked around at them with anger and sorrow at their hardness of heart. Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and it was restored. 6. At this, the Pharisees went out and began plotting with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. 7. So Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, accompanied by a large crowd from Galilee, Judea, 8. Jerusalem, Idumea, the region beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to Him when they heard what great things He was doing. 9. Jesus asked His disciples to have a boat ready for Him so that the crowd would not crush Him. 10. For He had healed so many that all who had diseases were pressing forward to touch Him. 11. And when the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!” 12. But He warned them sternly not to make Him known. 13. Then Jesus went up on the mountain and called for those He wanted, and they came to Him. 14. He appointed twelve of them, whom He designated as apostles, to accompany Him, to be sent out to preach, 15. and to have authority to drive out demons. 16. These are the twelve He appointed: Simon (whom He named Peter), 17. James son of Zebedee and his brother John (whom He named Boanerges, meaning “Sons of Thunder”), 18. Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, 19. and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. 20. Then Jesus went home, and once again a crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat. 21. When His family heard about this, they went out to take custody of Him, saying, “He is out of His mind.” 22. And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul, ” and, “By the prince of the demons He drives out demons.” 23. So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan? 24. If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand. 25. If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand. 26. And if Satan is divided and rises against himself, he cannot stand; his end has come. 27. Indeed, no one can enter a strong man’s house to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house. 28. Truly I tell you, the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and blasphemies, as many as they utter. 29. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of eternal sin.” 30. Jesus made this statement because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.” 31. Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came and stood outside. They sent someone in to summon Him, 32. and a crowd was sitting around Him. “Look,” He was told, “Your mother and brothers are outside, asking for You.” 33. But Jesus replied, “Who are My mother and My brothers?” 34. Looking at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers! 35. For whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother.”",
    "1. Once again Jesus began to teach beside the sea, and such a large crowd gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people crowded along the shore. 2. And He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said, 3. “Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. 4. And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. 5. Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow. 6. But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings, and they yielded no crop. 8. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprouted, grew up, and produced a crop—one bearing thirtyfold, another sixtyfold, and another a hundredfold.” 9. Then Jesus said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” 10. As soon as Jesus was alone with the Twelve and those around Him, they asked Him about the parable. 11. He replied, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those on the outside everything is expressed in parables, 12. so that, 13. Then Jesus said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables? 14. The farmer sows the word. 15. Some are like the seeds along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. 16. Some are like the seeds sown on rocky ground. They hear the word and at once receive it with joy. 17. But they themselves have no root, and they remain for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. 18. Others are like the seeds sown among the thorns. They hear the word, 19. but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 20. Still others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, receive it, and produce a crop—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.” 21. Jesus also said to them, “Does anyone bring in a lamp to put it under a basket or under a bed? Doesn’t he set it on a stand? 22. For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light. 23. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.” 24. He went on to say, “Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more will be added to you. 25. For whoever has will be given more. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.” 26. Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground. 27. Night and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he knows not how. 28. All by itself the earth produces a crop—first the stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within. 29. And as soon as the grain is ripe, he swings the sickle, because the harvest has come. ” 30. Then He asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God? With what parable shall we present it? 31. It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds sown upon the earth. 32. But after it is planted, it grows to be the largest of all garden plants and puts forth great branches, so that the birds of the air nest in its shade.” 33. With many such parables Jesus spoke the word to them, to the extent that they could understand. 34. He did not tell them anything without using a parable. But privately He explained everything to His own disciples. 35. When that evening came, He said to His disciples, “Let us cross to the other side.” 36. After they had dismissed the crowd, they took Jesus with them, since He was already in the boat. And there were other boats with Him. 37. Soon a violent windstorm came up, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was being swamped. 38. But Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke Him and said, “Teacher, don’t You care that we are perishing?” 39. Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the sea. “Silence!” He commanded. “Be still!” And the wind died down, and it was perfectly calm. 40. “Why are you so afraid?” He asked. “Do you still have no faith?” 41. Overwhelmed with fear, they asked one another, “Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”",
    "1. On the other side of the sea, they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes. 2. As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, He was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the tombs. 3. This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be restrained, even with chains. 4. Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him. 5. Night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he kept crying out and cutting himself with stones. 6. When the man saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees before Him. 7. And he shouted in a loud voice, “What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You before God not to torture me!” 8. For Jesus had already declared, “Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!” 9. “What is your name?” Jesus asked. “My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.” 10. And he begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of that region. 11. There on the nearby hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. 12. So the demons begged Jesus, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.” 13. He gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water. 14. Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. 15. When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 16. Those who had seen it described what had happened to the demon-possessed man and also to the pigs. 17. And the people began to beg Jesus to leave their region. 18. As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by the demons begged to go with Him. 19. But Jesus would not allow him. “Go home to your own people,” He said, “and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy He has shown you.” 20. So the man went away and began to proclaim throughout the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed. 21. When Jesus had again crossed by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him beside the sea. 22. A synagogue leader named Jairus arrived, and seeing Jesus, he fell at His feet 23. and pleaded with Him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Please come and place Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.” 24. So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around Him. 25. And a woman was there who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. 26. She had borne much agony under the care of many physicians and had spent all she had, but to no avail. Instead, her condition had only grown worse. 27. When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up through the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak. 28. For she kept saying, “If only I touch His garments, I will be healed.” 29. Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she sensed in her body that she was healed of her affliction. 30. At once Jesus was aware that power had gone out from Him. Turning to the crowd, He asked, “Who touched My garments?” 31. His disciples answered, “You can see the crowd pressing in on You, and yet You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’” 32. But He kept looking around to see who had done this. 33. Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him trembling in fear, and she told Him the whole truth. 34. “Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free of your affliction.” 35. While He was still speaking, messengers from the house of Jairus arrived and said, “Your daughter is dead; why bother the Teacher anymore?” 36. But Jesus overheard their conversation and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe.” 37. And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. 38. When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the people weeping and wailing loudly. 39. He went inside and asked, “Why all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but asleep.” 40. And they laughed at Him. After He had put them all outside, He took the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and went in to see the child. 41. Taking her by the hand, Jesus said, “Talitha koum!” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!” 42. Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around. She was twelve years old, and at once they were utterly astounded. 43. Then Jesus gave strict orders that no one should know about this, and He told them to give her something to eat.",
    "1. Jesus went on from there and came to His hometown, accompanied by His disciples. 2. When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. “Where did this man get these ideas?” they asked. “What is this wisdom He has been given? And how can He perform such miracles? 3. Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us as well?” And they took offense at Him. 4. Then Jesus said to them, “Only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a prophet without honor.” 5. So He could not perform any miracles there, except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them. 6. And He was amazed at their unbelief. And He went around from village to village, teaching the people. 7. Then Jesus called the Twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits. 8. He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts— 9. and to wear sandals, but not a second tunic. 10. And He told them, “When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area. 11. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that place, as a testimony against them.” 12. So they set out and preached that the people should repent. 13. They also drove out many demons and healed many of the sick, anointing them with oil. 14. Now King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known, and people were saying, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.” 15. Others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and still others, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” 16. But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead!” 17. For Herod himself had ordered that John be arrested and bound and imprisoned, on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, whom Herod had married. 18. For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife!” 19. So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she had been unable, 20. because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard John’s words, he was greatly perplexed; yet he listened to him gladly. 21. On Herod’s birthday, her opportunity arose. Herod held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. 22. When the daughter of Herodias came and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests, and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.” 23. And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom!” 24. Then she went out and asked her mother, “What should I request?” And her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptist.” 25. At once the girl hurried back to the king with her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.” 26. The king was consumed with sorrow, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her. 27. So without delay, the king commanded that John’s head be brought in. He sent an executioner, who went and beheaded him in the prison. 28. The man brought John’s head on a platter and presented it to the girl, who gave it to her mother. 29. When John’s disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb. 30. Meanwhile, the apostles gathered around Jesus and brought Him news of all they had done and taught. 31. And He said to them, “Come with Me privately to a solitary place, and let us rest for a while.” For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. 32. So they went away in a boat by themselves to a solitary place. 33. But many people saw them leaving and recognized them. They ran together on foot from all the towns and arrived before them. 34. When Jesus stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things. 35. By now the hour was already late. So the disciples came to Jesus and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. 36. Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” 37. But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.” They asked Him, “Should we go out and spend two hundred denarii to give all of them bread to eat?” 38. “Go and see how many loaves you have,” He told them. And after checking, they said, “Five—and two fish.” 39. Then Jesus directed them to have the people sit in groups on the green grass. 40. So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. 41. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And He divided the two fish among them all. 42. They all ate and were satisfied, 43. and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. 44. And there were five thousand men who had eaten the loaves. 45. Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd. 46. After bidding them farewell, He went up on the mountain to pray. 47. When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on land. 48. He could see that the disciples were straining to row, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. He intended to pass by them, 49. but when they saw Him walking on the sea, they cried out, thinking He was a ghost— 50. for they all saw Him and were terrified. But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.” 51. Then He climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. And the disciples were utterly astounded, 52. for they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts had been hardened. 53. When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and moored the boat. 54. As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus 55. and ran through that whole region, carrying the sick on mats to wherever they heard He was. 56. And wherever He went—villages and towns and countrysides—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.",
    "1. Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus, 2. and they saw some of His disciples eating with hands that were defiled—that is, unwashed. 3. Now in holding to the tradition of the elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially. 4. And on returning from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining. 5. So the Pharisees and scribes questioned Jesus: “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.” 6. Jesus answered them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: 7.  8. You have disregarded the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men. ” 9. He went on to say, “You neatly set aside the command of God to maintain your own tradition. 10. For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ 11. But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God), 12. he is no longer permitted to do anything for his father or mother. 13. Thus you nullify the word of God by the tradition you have handed down. And you do so in many such matters.” 14. Once again Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “All of you, listen to Me and understand: 15. Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him; but the things that come out of a man, these are what defile him.” 17. After Jesus had left the crowd and gone into the house, His disciples inquired about the parable. 18. “Are you still so dull?” He asked. “Do you not understand? Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him, 19. because it does not enter his heart, but it goes into the stomach and then is eliminated.” (Thus all foods are clean.) 20. He continued: “What comes out of a man, that is what defiles him. 21. For from within the hearts of men come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, 22. greed, wickedness, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness. 23. All these evils come from within, and these are what defile a man.” 24. Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre. Not wanting anyone to know He was there, He entered a house, but was unable to escape their notice. 25. Instead, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit soon heard about Jesus, and she came and fell at His feet. 26. Now she was a Greek woman of Syrophoenician origin, and she kept asking Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. 27. “First let the children have their fill,” He said. “For it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.” 28. “Yes, Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 29. Then Jesus told her, “Because of this answer, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.” 30. And she went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone. 31. Then Jesus left the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. 32. Some people brought to Him a man who was deaf and hardly able to speak, and they begged Jesus to place His hand on him. 33. So Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, and put His fingers into the man’s ears. Then He spit and touched the man’s tongue. 34. And looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (which means, “Be opened!”). 35. Immediately the man’s ears were opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak plainly. 36. Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more He ordered them, the more widely they proclaimed it. 37. The people were utterly astonished and said, “He has done all things well! He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”",
    "1. In those days the crowd once again became very large, and they had nothing to eat. Jesus called the disciples to Him and said, 2. “I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. 3. If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a great distance.” 4. His disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could anyone find enough bread to feed all these people?” 5. “How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied. 6. And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then He took the seven loaves, gave thanks and broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And they distributed them to the crowd. 7. They also had a few small fish, and Jesus blessed them and ordered that these be set before them as well. 8. The people ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 9. And about four thousand men were present. As soon as Jesus had dismissed the crowd, 10. He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha. 11. Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, testing Him by demanding from Him a sign from heaven. 12. Jesus sighed deeply in His spirit and said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.” 13. And He left them, got back into the boat, and crossed to the other side. 14. Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. 15. “Watch out!” He cautioned them. “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod.” 16. So they began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread. 17. Aware of their conversation, Jesus asked them, “Why are you debating about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Do you have such hard hearts? 18. ‘Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?’ And do you not remember? 19. When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you collect?” “Twelve,” they answered. 20. “And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you collect?” “Seven,” they said. 21. Then He asked them, “Do you still not understand?” 22. When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. 23. So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then He spit on the man’s eyes and placed His hands on him. “Can you see anything?” He asked. 24. The man looked up and said, “I can see the people, but they look like trees walking around.” 25. Once again Jesus placed His hands on the man’s eyes, and when he opened them his sight was restored, and he could see everything clearly. 26. Jesus sent him home and said, “Do not go back into the village.” 27. Then Jesus and His disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He questioned His disciples: “Who do people say I am?” 28. They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.” 29. “But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Christ.” 30. And Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about Him. 31. Then He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and after three days rise again. 32. He spoke this message quite frankly, and Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. 33. But Jesus, turning and looking at His disciples, rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind Me, Satan! For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.” 34. Then Jesus called the crowd to Him along with His disciples, and He told them, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. 35. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and for the gospel will save it. 36. What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? 37. Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? 38. If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in His Father’s glory with the holy angels.”",
    "1. Then Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.” 2. After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There He was transfigured before them. 3. His clothes became radiantly white, brighter than any launderer on earth could bleach them. 4. And Elijah and Moses appeared before them, talking with Jesus. 5. Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters —one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 6. For they were all so terrified that Peter did not know what else to say. 7. Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is My beloved Son. Listen to Him!” 8. Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one with them except Jesus. 9. As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus admonished them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 10. So they kept this matter to themselves, discussing what it meant to rise from the dead. 11. And they asked Jesus, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 12. He replied, “Elijah does indeed come first, and he restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected? 13. But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, just as it is written about him.” 14. When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. 15. As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were filled with awe and ran to greet Him. 16. “What are you disputing with them?” He asked. 17. Someone in the crowd replied, “Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a spirit that makes him mute. 18. Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.” 19. “O unbelieving generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to Me.” 20. So they brought him, and seeing Jesus, the spirit immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. 21. Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has this been with him?” “From childhood,” he said. 22. “It often throws him into the fire or into the water, trying to kill him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” 23. “If You can?” echoed Jesus. “All things are possible to him who believes!” 24. Immediately the boy’s father cried out, “I do believe; help my unbelief!” 25. When Jesus saw that a crowd had come running, He rebuked the unclean spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” He said, “I command you to come out and never enter him again.” 26. After shrieking and convulsing him violently, the spirit came out. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, “He is dead.” 27. But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up. 28. After Jesus had gone into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” 29. Jesus answered, “This kind cannot come out, except by prayer.” 30. Going on from there, they passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know, 31. because He was teaching His disciples. He told them, “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill Him, and after three days He will rise.” 32. But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him about it. 33. Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was in the house, He asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?” 34. But they were silent, for on the way they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. 35. Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be the last of all and the servant of all.” 36. Then He had a little child stand among them. Taking the child in His arms, He said to them, 37. “Whoever welcomes one of these little children in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes not only Me, but the One who sent Me.” 38. John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone else driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.” 39. “Do not stop him,” Jesus replied. “For no one who performs a miracle in My name can turn around and speak evil of Me. 40. For whoever is not against us is for us. 41. Indeed, if anyone gives you even a cup of water because you bear the name of Christ, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward. 42. But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea. 43. If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two hands and go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 45. If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. 47. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, 48. where ‘their worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched.’ 49. For everyone will be salted with fire. 50. Salt is good, but if the salt loses its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”",
    "1. Then Jesus left that place and went into the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan. Again the crowds came to Him and He taught them, as was His custom. 2. Some Pharisees came to test Him. “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” they inquired. 3. “What did Moses command you?” He replied. 4. They answered, “Moses permitted a man to write his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away.” 5. But Jesus told them, “Moses wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart. 6. However, from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ 7. ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, 8. and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh. 9. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.” 10. When they were back inside the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter. 11. So He told them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. 12. And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.” 13. Now people were bringing the little children to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them, and the disciples rebuked those who brought them. 14. But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and told them, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 15. Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” 16. And He took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them. 17. As Jesus started on His way, a man ran up and knelt before Him. “Good Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18. “Why do you call Me good?” Jesus replied. “No one is good except God alone. 19. You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not cheat others, honor your father and mother.’ ” 20. “Teacher,” he replied, “all these I have kept from my youth.” 21. Jesus looked at him, loved him, and said to him, “There is one thing you lack: Go, sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me. ” 22. But the man was saddened by these words and went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth. 23. Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!” 24. And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 26. They were even more astonished and said to one another, “Who then can be saved?” 27. Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” 28. Peter began to say to Him, “Look, we have left everything and followed You.” 29. “Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel 30. will fail to receive a hundredfold in the present age—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life. 31. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.” 32. As they were going up the road to Jerusalem, Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were amazed, but those who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him: 33. “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn Him to death and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles, 34. who will mock Him and spit on Him and flog Him and kill Him. And after three days He will rise again.” 35. Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and declared, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.” 36. “What do you want Me to do for you?” He inquired. 37. They answered, “Grant that one of us may sit at Your right hand and the other at Your left in Your glory.” 38. “You do not know what you are asking,” Jesus replied. “Can you drink the cup I will drink, or be baptized with the baptism I will undergo?” 39. “We can,” the brothers answered. “You will drink the cup that I drink,” Jesus said, “and you will be baptized with the baptism that I undergo. 40. But to sit at My right or left is not Mine to grant. These seats belong to those for whom they have been prepared.” 41. When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. 42. So Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority over them. 43. But it shall not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 44. and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all. 45. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” 46. Next, they came to Jericho. And as Jesus and His disciples were leaving Jericho with a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road. 47. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 48. Many people admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 49. Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called the blind man. “Take courage!” they said. “Get up! He is calling for you.” 50. Throwing off his cloak, Bartimaeus jumped up and came to Jesus. 51. “What do you want Me to do for you?” Jesus asked. “Rabboni,” said the blind man, “let me see again.” 52. “Go,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you.” And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.",
    "1. As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two of His disciples 2. and said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. 3. If anyone asks, ‘Why are you doing this?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it and will return it shortly.’” 4. So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. They untied it, 5. and some who were standing there asked, “Why are you untying the colt?” 6. The disciples answered as Jesus had instructed them, and the people gave them permission. 7. Then they led the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and He sat on it. 8. Many in the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut from the fields. 9. The ones who went ahead and those who followed were shouting: 10.  11. Then Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve. 12. The next day, when they had left Bethany, Jesus was hungry. 13. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if there was any fruit on it. But when He reached it, He found nothing on it except leaves, since it was not the season for figs. 14. Then He said to the tree, “May no one ever eat of your fruit again.” And His disciples heard this statement. 15. When they arrived in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves. 16. And He would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. 17. Then Jesus began to teach them, and He declared, “Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’ ? But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’ ” 18. When the chief priests and scribes heard this, they looked for a way to kill Him. For they were afraid of Him, because the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching. 19. And when evening came, Jesus and His disciples went out of the city. 20. As they were walking back in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from its roots. 21. Peter remembered it and said, “Look, Rabbi! The fig tree You cursed has withered.” 22. “Have faith in God,” Jesus said to them. 23. “Truly I tell you that if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and has no doubt in his heart but believes that it will happen, it will be done for him. 24. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. 25. And when you stand to pray, if you hold anything against another, forgive it, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your trespasses as well. ” 27. After their return to Jerusalem, Jesus was walking in the temple courts, and the chief priests, scribes, and elders came up to Him. 28. “By what authority are You doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave You the authority to do them?” 29. “I will ask you one question,” Jesus replied, “and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 30. John’s baptism—was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me!” 31. They deliberated among themselves what they should answer: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 32. But if we say, ‘From men’...” they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John truly was a prophet. 33. So they answered, “We do not know.” And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”",
    "1. Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a wine vat, and built a watchtower. Then he rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey. 2. At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. 3. But they seized the servant, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 4. Then he sent them another servant, and they struck him over the head and treated him shamefully. 5. He sent still another, and this one they killed. He sent many others; some they beat and others they killed. 6. Finally, having one beloved son, he sent him to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. 7. But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ 8. So they seized the son, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. 9. What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others. 10. Have you never read this Scripture: 11.  12. At this, the leaders sought to arrest Jesus, for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them. But fearing the crowd, they left Him and went away. 13. Later, they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to catch Jesus in His words. 14. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are honest and seek favor from no one. Indeed, You are impartial and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or not?” 15. But Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, “Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to inspect.” 16. So they brought it, and He asked them, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” “Caesar’s,” they answered. 17. Then Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” And they marveled at Him. 18. Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him: 19. “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him. 20. Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died, leaving no children. 21. Then the second one married the widow, but he also died and left no children. And the third did likewise. 22. In this way, none of the seven left any children. And last of all, the woman died. 23. In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.” 24. Jesus said to them, “Aren’t you mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? 25. When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven. 26. But concerning the dead rising, have you not read about the burning bush in the Book of Moses, how God told him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’ ? 27. He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!” 28. Now one of the scribes had come up and heard their debate. Noticing how well Jesus had answered them, he asked Him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” 29. Jesus replied, “This is the most important: ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One. 30. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ 31. The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these.” 32. “Right, Teacher,” the scribe replied. “You have stated correctly that God is One and there is no other but Him, 33. and to love Him with all your heart and with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, which is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” 34. When Jesus saw that the man had answered wisely, He said, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to question Him any further. 35. While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, He asked, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David? 36. Speaking by the Holy Spirit, David himself declared: 37. David himself calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?” And the large crowd listened to Him with delight. 38. In His teaching Jesus also said, “Watch out for the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, to receive greetings in the marketplaces, 39. and to have the chief seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. 40. They defraud widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.” 41. As Jesus was sitting opposite the treasury, He watched the crowd putting money into it. And many rich people put in large amounts. 42. Then one poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amounted to a small fraction of a denarius. 43. Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more than all the others into the treasury. 44. For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.”",
    "1. As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, “Teacher, look at the magnificent stones and buildings!” 2. “Do you see all these great buildings?” Jesus replied. “Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.” 3. While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately, 4. “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?” 5. Jesus began by telling them, “See to it that no one deceives you. 6. Many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am He,’ and will deceive many. 7. When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come. 8. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, as well as famines. These are the beginning of birth pains. 9. So be on your guard. You will be delivered over to the councils and beaten in the synagogues. On My account you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them. 10. And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations. 11. But when they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand what to say. Instead, speak whatever you are given at that time, for it will not be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. 12. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against their parents and have them put to death. 13. You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. 14. So when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 15. Let no one on the housetop go back inside to retrieve anything from his house. 16. And let no one in the field return for his cloak. 17. How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! 18. Pray that this will not occur in the winter. 19. For those will be days of tribulation unmatched from the beginning of God’s creation until now, and never to be seen again. 20. If the Lord had not cut short those days, nobody would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom He has chosen, He has cut them short. 21. At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There He is!’ do not believe it. 22. For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders that would deceive even the elect, if that were possible. 23. So be on your guard; I have told you everything in advance. 24. But in those days, after that tribulation: 25.  26. At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. 27. And He will send out the angels to gather His elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven. 28. Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near. 29. So also, when you see these things happening, know that He is near, right at the door. 30. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened. 31. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. 32. No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 33. Be on your guard and stay alert! For you do not know when the appointed time will come. 34. It is like a man going on a journey who left his house, put each servant in charge of his own task, and instructed the doorkeeper to keep watch. 35. Therefore keep watch, because you do not know when the master of the house will return—whether in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or in the morning. 36. Otherwise, he may arrive without notice and find you sleeping. 37. And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Keep watch!”",
    "1. Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were two days away, and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a covert way to arrest Jesus and kill Him. 2. “But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.” 3. While Jesus was in Bethany reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke open the jar and poured it on Jesus’ head. 4. Some of those present, however, expressed their indignation to one another: “Why this waste of perfume? 5. It could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor.” And they scolded her. 6. But Jesus said, “Leave her alone; why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful deed to Me. 7. The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them whenever you want. But you will not always have Me. 8. She has done what she could to anoint My body in advance of My burial. 9. And truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.” 10. Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. 11. They were delighted to hear this, and they promised to give him money. So Judas began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus. 12. On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples asked Him, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?” 13. So He sent two of His disciples and told them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him, 14. and whichever house he enters, say to the owner, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is My guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’ 15. And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.” 16. So the disciples left and went into the city, where they found everything as Jesus had described. And they prepared the Passover. 17. When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. 18. And while they were reclining and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, one of you who is eating with Me will betray Me.” 19. They began to be grieved and to ask Him one after another, “Surely not I?” 20. He answered, “It is one of the Twelve—the one who is dipping his hand into the bowl with Me. 21. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had not been born.” 22. While they were eating, Jesus took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take it; this is My body.” 23. Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 24. He said to them, “This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. 25. Truly I tell you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.” 26. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 27. Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, for it is written: 28. But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 29. Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I never will.” 30. “Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” 31. But Peter kept insisting, “Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the others said the same thing. 32. Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus told His disciples, “Sit here while I pray.” 33. He took with Him Peter, James, and John, and began to be deeply troubled and distressed. 34. Then He said to them, “My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.” 35. Going a little farther, He fell to the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from Him. 36. “Abba, Father,” He said, “all things are possible for You. Take this cup from Me. Yet not what I will, but what You will.” 37. Then Jesus returned and found them sleeping. “Simon, are you asleep?” He asked. “Were you not able to keep watch for one hour? 38. Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” 39. Again He went away and prayed, saying the same thing. 40. And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping—for their eyes were heavy. And they did not know what to answer Him. 41. When Jesus returned the third time, He said, “Are you still sleeping and resting? That is enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 42. Rise, let us go. See, My betrayer is approaching!” 43. While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, scribes, and elders. 44. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him and lead Him away securely.” 45. Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Rabbi!” and kissed Him. 46. Then the men seized Jesus and arrested Him. 47. And one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. 48. Jesus asked the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw? 49. Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest Me. But this has happened that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.” 50. Then everyone deserted Him and fled. 51. One young man who had been following Jesus was wearing a linen cloth around his body. They caught hold of him, 52. but he pulled free of the linen cloth and ran away naked. 53. They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders, and scribes assembled. 54. Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the officers and warmed himself by the fire. 55. Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but they did not find any. 56. For many bore false witness against Jesus, but their testimony was inconsistent. 57. Then some men stood up and testified falsely against Him: 58. “We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this man-made temple, and in three days I will build another that is made without hands.’” 59. But even their testimony was inconsistent. 60. So the high priest stood up before them and questioned Jesus, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?” 61. But Jesus remained silent and made no reply. Again the high priest questioned Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” 62. “I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.” 63. At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “Why do we need any more witnesses? 64. You have heard the blasphemy. What is your verdict?” And they all condemned Him as deserving of death. 65. Then some of them began to spit on Him. They blindfolded Him, struck Him with their fists, and said to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps in His face. 66. While Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the servant girls of the high priest came down 67. and saw him warming himself there. She looked at Peter and said, “You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.” 68. But he denied it. “I do not know or even understand what you are talking about,” he said. Then he went out to the gateway, and the rooster crowed. 69. There the servant girl saw him and again said to those standing nearby, “This man is one of them.” 70. But he denied it again. After a little while, those standing nearby said once more to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you too are a Galilean.” 71. But he began to curse and swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak!” 72. And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And he broke down and wept.",
    "1. Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin devised a plan. They bound Jesus, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate. 2. So Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied. 3. And the chief priests began to accuse Him of many things. 4. Then Pilate questioned Him again, “Have You no answer? Look how many charges they are bringing against You!” 5. But to Pilate’s amazement, Jesus made no further reply. 6. Now it was Pilate’s custom at the feast to release to the people a prisoner of their choosing. 7. And a man named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection. 8. So the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to keep his custom. 9. “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” Pilate asked. 10. For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over. 11. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead. 12. So Pilate asked them again, “What then do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews?” 13. And they shouted back, “Crucify Him!” 14. “Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!” 15. And wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified. 16. Then the soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called the whole company together. 17. They dressed Him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and set it on His head. 18. And they began to salute Him: “Hail, King of the Jews!” 19. They kept striking His head with a staff and spitting on Him. And they knelt down and bowed before Him. 20. After they had mocked Him, they removed the purple robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him out to crucify Him. 21. Now Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and the soldiers forced him to carry the cross of Jesus. 22. They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull. 23. There they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it. 24. And they crucified Him. They also divided His garments by casting lots to decide what each of them would take. 25. It was the third hour when they crucified Him. 26. And the charge inscribed against Him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. 27. Along with Jesus, they crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left. 29. And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 30. come down from the cross and save Yourself!” 31. In the same way, the chief priests and scribes mocked Him among themselves, saying, “He saved others, but He cannot save Himself! 32. Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe!” And even those who were crucified with Him berated Him. 33. From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. 34. At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” 35. When some of those standing nearby heard this, they said, “Behold, He is calling Elijah.” 36. And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine. He put it on a reed and held it up for Jesus to drink, saying, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.” 37. But Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed His last. 38. And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 39. When the centurion standing there in front of Jesus saw how He had breathed His last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!” 40. And there were also women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. 41. These women had followed Jesus and ministered to Him while He was in Galilee, and there were many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with Him. 42. Now it was already evening. Since it was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath), 43. Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent Council member who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God, boldly went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus. 44. Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead, so he summoned the centurion to ask if this was so. 45. When Pilate had confirmed it with the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 46. So Joseph bought a linen cloth, took down the body of Jesus, wrapped it in the cloth, and placed it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb. 47. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where His body was placed.",
    "1. When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so they could go and anoint the body of Jesus. 2. Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they went to the tomb. 3. They were asking one another, “Who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb?” 4. But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, even though it was extremely large. 5. When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. 6. But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here! See the place where they put Him. 7. But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him, just as He told you.’” 8. So the women left the tomb and ran away, trembling and bewildered. And in their fear they did not say a word to anyone. 9. Early on the first day of the week, after Jesus had risen, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had driven out seven demons. 10. She went and told those who had been with Him, who were mourning and weeping. 11. And when they heard that Jesus was alive and she had seen Him, they did not believe it. 12. After this, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them as they walked along in the country. 13. And they went back and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either. 14. Later, as they were eating, Jesus appeared to the Eleven and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen. 15. And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. 16. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18. they will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not harm them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will be made well.” 19. After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 20. And they went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked through them, confirming His word by the signs that accompanied it."

  "Luke": [
    "1. Many have undertaken to compose an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2. just as they were handed down to us by the initial eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3. Therefore, having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4. so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. 5. In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and whose wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron. 6. Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and decrees of the Lord. 7. But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well along in years. 8. One day while Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 9. he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 10. And at the hour of the incense offering, the whole congregation was praying outside. 11. Just then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 12. When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear. 13. But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. 14. He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice at his birth, 15. for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall never take wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb. 16. Many of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God. 17. And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” 18. “How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.” 19. “I am Gabriel,” replied the angel. “I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. 20. And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day this comes to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.” 21. Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he took so long in the temple. 22. When he came out and was unable to speak to them, they realized he had seen a vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless. 23. And when the days of his service were complete, he returned home. 24. After these days, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. She declared, 25. “The Lord has done this for me. In these days He has shown me favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.” 26. In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, 27. to a virgin pledged in marriage to a man named Joseph, who was of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary. 28. The angel appeared to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you. ” 29. Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 30. So the angel told her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31. Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus. 32. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David, 33. and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will never end!” 34. “How can this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?” 35. The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God. 36. Look, even Elizabeth your relative has conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called barren is in her sixth month. 37. For no word from God will ever fail. ” 38. “I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May it happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel left her. 39. In those days Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah, 40. where she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. 41. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 42. In a loud voice she exclaimed, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 43. And why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 44. For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 45. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord’s word to her will be fulfilled.” 46. Then Mary said: 47.  48.  49.  50.  51.  52.  53.  54.  55.  56. Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. 57. When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son. 58. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they rejoiced with her. 59. On the eighth day, when they came to circumcise the child, they were going to name him after his father Zechariah. 60. But his mother replied, “No! He shall be called John.” 61. They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who bears this name.” 62. So they made signs to his father to find out what he wanted to name the child. 63. Zechariah asked for a tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed. 64. Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak, praising God. 65. All their neighbors were filled with awe, and people throughout the hill country of Judea were talking about these events. 66. And all who heard this wondered in their hearts and asked, “What then will this child become?” For the Lord’s hand was with him. 67. Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied: 68.  69.  70.  71.  72.  73.  74.  75.  76.  77.  78.  79.  80. And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until the time of his public appearance to Israel.",
    "1. Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole empire. 2. This was the first census to take place while Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3. And everyone went to his own town to register. 4. So Joseph also went up from Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, since he was from the house and line of David. 5. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to him in marriage and was expecting a child. 6. While they were there, the time came for her Child to be born. 7. And she gave birth to her firstborn, a Son. She wrapped Him in swaddling cloths and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. 8. And there were shepherds residing in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks by night. 9. Just then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! For behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people: 11. Today in the city of David a Savior has been born to you. He is Christ the Lord! 12. And this will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” 13. And suddenly there appeared with the angel a great multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying: 14.  15. When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” 16. So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the Baby, who was lying in the manger. 17. After they had seen the Child, they spread the message they had received about Him. 18. And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, which was just as the angel had told them. 21. When the eight days until His circumcision had passed, He was named Jesus, the name the angel had given Him before He had been conceived. 22. And when the time of purification according to the Law of Moses was complete, His parents brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord 23. (as it is written in the Law of the Lord: “Every firstborn male shall be consecrated to the Lord” ), 24. and to offer the sacrifice specified in the Law of the Lord: “A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.” 25. Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 26. The Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. 27. Led by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for Him what was customary under the Law, 28. Simeon took Him in his arms and blessed God, saying: 29.  30.  31.  32.  33. The Child’s father and mother were amazed at what was spoken about Him. 34. Then Simeon blessed them and said to His mother Mary: 35.  36. There was also a prophetess named Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, who was well along in years. She had been married for seven years, 37. and then was a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. 38. Coming forward at that moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the Child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem. 39. When Jesus’ parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. 40. And the Child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him. 41. Every year His parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. 42. And when He was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the Feast. 43. When those days were over and they were returning home, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but His parents were unaware He had stayed. 44. Assuming He was in their company, they traveled on for a day before they began to look for Him among their relatives and friends. 45. When they could not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for Him. 46. Finally, after three days they found Him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 47. And all who heard Him were astounded at His understanding and His answers. 48. When His parents saw Him, they were astonished. “Child, why have You done this to us?” His mother asked. “Your father and I have been anxiously searching for You.” 49. “Why were you looking for Me?” He asked. “Did you not know that I had to be in My Father’s house ?” 50. But they did not understand the statement He was making to them. 51. Then He went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But His mother treasured up all these things in her heart. 52. And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.",
    "1. In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 2. during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. 3. He went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, 4. as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: 5.  6.  7. Then John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8. Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 9. The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” 10. The crowds asked him, “What then should we do?” 11. John replied, “Whoever has two tunics should share with him who has none, and whoever has food should do the same.” 12. Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?” 13. “Collect no more than you are authorized,” he answered. 14. Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?” “Do not take money by force or false accusation,” he said. “Be content with your wages.” 15. The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John could be the Christ. 16. John answered all of them: “I baptize you with water, but One more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 17. His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 18. With these and many other exhortations, John proclaimed the good news to the people. 19. But when he rebuked Herod the tetrarch regarding his brother’s wife Herodias and all the evils he had done, 20. Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison. 21. When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as He was praying, heaven was opened, 22. and the Holy Spirit descended on Him in a bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.” 23. Jesus Himself was about thirty years old when He began His ministry. 24.  25.  26.  27.  28.  29.  30.  31.  32.  33.  34.  35.  36.  37.  38. ",
    "1. Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2. where for forty days He was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He was hungry. 3. The devil said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.” 4. But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’ ” 5. Then the devil led Him up to a high place and showed Him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. 6. “I will give You authority over all these kingdoms and all their glory,” he said. “For it has been relinquished to me, and I can give it to anyone I wish. 7. So if You worship me, it will all be Yours.” 8. But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’ ” 9. Then the devil led Him to Jerusalem and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple. “If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down from here. 10. For it is written: 11.  12. But Jesus answered, “It also says, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ” 13. When the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time. 14. Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news about Him spread throughout the surrounding region. 15. He taught in their synagogues and was glorified by everyone. 16. Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. As was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath. And when He stood up to read, 17. the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. Unrolling it, He found the place where it was written: 18.  19.  20. Then He rolled up the scroll, returned it to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on Him, 21. and He began by saying, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.” 22. All spoke well of Him and marveled at the gracious words that came from His lips. “Isn’t this the son of Joseph?” they asked. 23. Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to Me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! Do here in Your hometown what we have heard that You did in Capernaum.’” 24. Then He added, “Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in his hometown. 25. But I tell you truthfully that there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and great famine swept over all the land. 26. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to the widow of Zarephath in Sidon. 27. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet. Yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.” 28. On hearing this, all the people in the synagogue were enraged. 29. They got up, drove Him out of the town, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw Him over the cliff. 30. But Jesus passed through the crowd and went on His way. 31. Then He went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath He began to teach the people. 32. They were astonished at His teaching, because His message had authority. 33. In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon. He cried out in a loud voice, 34. “Ha! What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” 35. But Jesus rebuked the demon. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!” At this, the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without harming him. 36. All the people were overcome with amazement and asked one another, “What is this message? With authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” 37. And the news about Jesus spread throughout the surrounding region. 38. After Jesus had left the synagogue, He went to the home of Simon, whose mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever. So they appealed to Jesus on her behalf, 39. and He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she got up at once and began to serve them. 40. At sunset, all who were ill with various diseases were brought to Jesus, and laying His hands on each one, He healed them. 41. Demons also came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But He rebuked the demons and would not allow them to speak, because they knew He was the Christ. 42. At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place, and the crowds were looking for Him. They came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving. 43. But Jesus told them, “I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well, because that is why I was sent.” 44. And He continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea.",
    "1. On one occasion, while Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret with the crowd pressing in on Him to hear the word of God, 2. He saw two boats at the edge of the lake. The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. 3. Jesus got into the boat belonging to Simon and asked him to put out a little from shore. And sitting down, He taught the people from the boat. 4. When Jesus had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Put out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch.” 5. “Master,” Simon replied, “we have worked hard all night without catching anything. But because You say so, I will let down the nets.” 6. When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear. 7. So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. 8. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees. “Go away from me, Lord,” he said, “for I am a sinful man.” 9. For he and his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, 10. and so were his partners James and John, the sons of Zebedee. “Do not be afraid,” Jesus said to Simon. “From now on you will catch men.” 11. And when they had brought their boats ashore, they left everything and followed Him. 12. While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell facedown and begged Him, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” 13. Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him. 14. “Do not tell anyone,” Jesus instructed him. “But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” 15. But the news about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses. 16. Yet He frequently withdrew to the wilderness to pray. 17. One day Jesus was teaching, and the Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. People had come from Jerusalem and from every village of Galilee and Judea, and the power of the Lord was present for Him to heal the sick. 18. Just then some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. They tried to bring him inside to set him before Jesus, 19. but they could not find a way through the crowd. So they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. 20. When Jesus saw their faith, He said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.” 21. But the scribes and Pharisees began thinking to themselves, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 22. Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus replied, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? 23. Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’ 24. But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins...” He said to the paralytic, “I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.” 25. And immediately the man stood up before them, took what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God. 26. Everyone was taken with amazement and glorified God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.” 27. After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, 28. and Levi got up, left everything, and followed Him. 29. Then Levi hosted a great banquet for Jesus at his house. A large crowd of tax collectors was there, along with others who were eating with them. 30. But the Pharisees and their scribes complained to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” 31. Jesus answered, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 32. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” 33. Then they said to Him, “John’s disciples and those of the Pharisees frequently fast and pray, but Yours keep on eating and drinking.” 34. Jesus replied, “Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them? 35. But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.” 36. He also told them a parable: “No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will tear the new garment as well, and the patch from the new will not match the old. 37. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. 38. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins. 39. And no one after drinking old wine wants new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”",
    "1. One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat them. 2. But some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” 3. Jesus replied, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 4. He entered the house of God, took the consecrated bread and gave it to his companions, and ate what is lawful only for the priests to eat.” 5. Then Jesus declared, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” 6. On another Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered. 7. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, the scribes and Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath. 8. But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and stand among us.” So he got up and stood there. 9. Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” 10. And after looking around at all of them, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and it was restored. 11. But the scribes and Pharisees were filled with rage and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. 12. In those days Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the night in prayer to God. 13. When daylight came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also designated as apostles: 14. Simon, whom He named Peter, and his brother Andrew; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; 15. Matthew and Thomas; James son of Alphaeus and Simon called the Zealot; 16. Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. 17. Then Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of His disciples was there, along with a great number of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon. 18. They had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases, and those troubled by unclean spirits were healed. 19. The entire crowd was trying to touch Him, because power was coming from Him and healing them all. 20. Looking up at His disciples, Jesus said: 21.  22. Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man. 23. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For their fathers treated the prophets in the same way. 24.  25.  26.  27. But to those of you who will listen, I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28. bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 29. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone takes your cloak, do not withhold your tunic as well. 30. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what is yours, do not demand it back. 31. Do to others as you would have them do to you. 32. If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. 33. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same. 34. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. 35. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 36. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. 37. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. 38. Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.” 39. Jesus also told them a parable: “Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? 40. A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher. 41. Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye? 42. How can you say, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while you yourself fail to see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye. 43. No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. 44. For each tree is known by its own fruit. Indeed, figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor grapes from brambles. 45. The good man brings good things out of the good treasure of his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil treasure of his heart. For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks. 46. Why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,’ but not do what I say? 47. I will show you what he is like who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them: 48. He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid his foundation on the rock. When the flood came, the torrent crashed against that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. 49. But the one who hears My words and does not act on them is like a man who built his house on ground without a foundation. The torrent crashed against that house, and immediately it fell—and great was its destruction!”",
    "1. When Jesus had concluded His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum. 2. There a highly valued servant of a centurion was sick and about to die. 3. When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask Him to come and heal his servant. 4. They came to Jesus and pleaded with Him earnestly, “This man is worthy to have You grant this, 5. for he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” 6. So Jesus went with them. But when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends with the message: “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. 7. That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to You. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 8. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.” 9. When Jesus heard this, He marveled at the centurion. Turning to the crowd following Him, He said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.” 10. And when the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant in good health. 11. Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain. His disciples went with Him, accompanied by a large crowd. 12. As He approached the town gate, He saw a dead man being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. 13. When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said, “Do not weep.” 14. Then He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. “Young man,” He said, “I tell you, get up!” 15. And the dead man sat up and began to speak! Then Jesus gave him back to his mother. 16. A sense of awe swept over all of them, and they glorified God. “A great prophet has appeared among us!” they said. “God has visited His people!” 17. And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding region. 18. Then John’s disciples informed him about all these things. 19. So John called two of his disciples and sent them to ask the Lord, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?” 20. When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to ask, ‘Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?’” 21. At that very hour Jesus healed many people of their diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and He gave sight to many who were blind. 22. So He replied, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. 23. Blessed is the one who does not fall away on account of Me. ” 24. After John’s messengers had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind? 25. Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear elegant clothing and live in luxury are found in palaces. 26. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 27. This is the one about whom it is written: 28. I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John, yet even the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” 29. All the people who heard this, even the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice. For they had received the baptism of John. 30. But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John. 31. “To what, then, can I compare the men of this generation? What are they like? 32. They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another: 33. For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’ 34. The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ 35. But wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” 36. Then one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him, and He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. 37. When a sinful woman from that town learned that Jesus was dining there, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume. 38. As she stood behind Him at His feet weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears and wipe them with her hair. Then she kissed His feet and anointed them with the perfume. 39. When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, He would know who this is and what kind of woman is touching Him—for she is a sinner!” 40. But Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, Teacher,” he said. 41. “Two men were debtors to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42. When they were unable to repay him, he forgave both of them. Which one, then, will love him more?” 43. “I suppose the one who was forgiven more,” Simon replied. “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said. 44. And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give Me water for My feet, but she wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 45. You did not greet Me with a kiss, but she has not stopped kissing My feet since I arrived. 46. You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with perfume. 47. Therefore I tell you, because her many sins have been forgiven, she has loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.” 48. Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 49. But those at the table began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” 50. And Jesus told the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”",
    "1. Soon afterward, Jesus traveled from one town and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him, 2. as well as some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, 3. Joanna the wife of Herod’s household manager Chuza, Susanna, and many others. These women were ministering to them out of their own means. 4. While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, He told them this parable: 5. “A farmer went out to sow his seed. And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, where it was trampled, and the birds of the air devoured it. 6. Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the seedlings withered because they had no moisture. 7. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the seedlings. 8. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprang up and produced a crop—a hundredfold.” As Jesus said this, He called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” 9. Then His disciples asked Him what this parable meant. 10. He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, 11. Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. 12. The seeds along the path are those who hear, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. 13. The seeds on rocky ground are those who hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a season, but in the time of testing, they fall away. 14. The seeds that fell among the thorns are those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature. 15. But the seeds on good soil are those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, cling to it, and by persevering produce a crop. 16. No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light. 17. For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light. 18. Pay attention, therefore, to how you listen. Whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.” 19. Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see Him, but they were unable to reach Him because of the crowd. 20. He was told, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see You.” 21. But He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear the word of God and carry it out.” 22. One day Jesus said to His disciples, “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So He got into a boat with them and set out. 23. As they sailed, He fell asleep, and a windstorm came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. 24. The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters, and they subsided, and all was calm. 25. “Where is your faith?” He asked. Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!” 26. Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee. 27. When Jesus stepped ashore, He was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house, but he stayed in the tombs. 28. When the man saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, shouting in a loud voice, “What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You not to torture me!” 29. For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and been driven by the demon into solitary places. 30. “What is your name?” Jesus asked. “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. 31. And the demons kept begging Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss. 32. There on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. So the demons begged Jesus to let them enter the pigs, and He gave them permission. 33. Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. 34. When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside. 35. So the people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man whom the demons had left, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 36. Meanwhile, those who had seen it reported how the demon-possessed man had been healed. 37. Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, because great fear had taken hold of them. So He got into the boat and started back. 38. The man whom the demons had left begged to go with Jesus. But He sent him away, saying, 39. “Return home and describe how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and proclaimed all over the town how much Jesus had done for him. 40. When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him. 41. Just then a synagogue leader named Jairus came and fell at Jesus’ feet. He begged Him to come to his house, 42. because his only daughter, who was about twelve, was dying. As Jesus went with him, the crowds pressed around Him, 43. including a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all her money on physicians, but no one was able to heal her. 44. She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. 45. “Who touched Me?” Jesus asked. But they all denied it. “Master,” said Peter, “the people are crowding and pressing against You.” 46. But Jesus declared, “Someone touched Me, for I know that power has gone out from Me.” 47. Then the woman, seeing that she could not escape notice, came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched Him and how she had immediately been healed. 48. “Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace.” 49. While He was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he told Jairus. “Do not bother the Teacher anymore.” 50. But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.” 51. When He entered the house, He did not allow anyone to go in with Him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s father and mother. 52. Meanwhile, everyone was weeping and mourning for her. But Jesus said, “Stop weeping; she is not dead but asleep.” 53. And they laughed at Him, knowing that she was dead. 54. But Jesus took her by the hand and called out, “Child, get up!” 55. Her spirit returned, and at once she got up. And He directed that she be given something to eat. 56. Her parents were astounded, but Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.",
    "1. Then Jesus called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and power to cure diseases. 2. And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 3. “Take nothing for the journey,” He told them, “no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no second tunic. 4. Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that area. 5. If anyone does not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that town, as a testimony against them.” 6. So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere. 7. When Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, he was perplexed. For some were saying that John had risen from the dead, 8. others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that a prophet of old had arisen. 9. “I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but who is this man I hear such things about?” And he kept trying to see Jesus. 10. Then the apostles returned and reported to Jesus all that they had done. Taking them away privately, He withdrew to a town called Bethsaida. 11. But the crowds found out and followed Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and He healed those who needed healing. 12. As the day neared its end, the Twelve came to Jesus and said, “Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside for lodging and provisions. For we are in a desolate place here.” 13. But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.” “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered, “unless we go and buy food for all these people.” 14. (There were about five thousand men.) He told His disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” 15. They did so, and everyone was seated. 16. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples to set before the people. 17. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 18. One day as Jesus was praying in private and the disciples were with Him, He questioned them: “Who do the crowds say I am?” 19. They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that a prophet of old has arisen.” 20. “But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” 21. Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. 22. “The Son of Man must suffer many things,” He said. “He must be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.” 23. Then Jesus said to all of them, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me. 24. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it. 25. What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet lose or forfeit his very self? 26. If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. 27. But I tell you truthfully, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.” 28. About eight days after Jesus had said these things, He took with Him Peter, John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray. 29. And as He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothes became radiantly white. 30. Suddenly two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with Jesus. 31. They appeared in glory and spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. 32. Meanwhile Peter and his companions were overcome by sleep, but when they awoke, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with Him. 33. As Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters —one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.) 34. While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 35. And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to Him!” 36. After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was present with them. The disciples kept this to themselves, and in those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen. 37. The next day, when they came down from the mountain, Jesus was met by a large crowd. 38. Suddenly a man in the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only child. 39. A spirit keeps seizing him, and he screams abruptly. It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It keeps mauling him and rarely departs from him. 40. I begged Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.” 41. “O unbelieving and perverse generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.” 42. Even while the boy was approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. 43. And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples, 44. “Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.” 45. But they did not understand this statement. It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it. 46. Then an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. 47. But Jesus, knowing the thoughts of their hearts, had a little child stand beside Him. 48. And He said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me. For whoever is the least among all of you, he is the greatest.” 49. “Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.” 50. “Do not stop him,” Jesus replied, “for whoever is not against you is for you.” 51. As the day of His ascension approached, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. 52. He sent messengers on ahead, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him. 53. But the people there refused to welcome Him, because He was heading for Jerusalem. 54. When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do You want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?” 55. But Jesus turned and rebuked them. 56. And He and His disciples went on to another village. 57. As they were walking along the road, someone said to Jesus, “I will follow You wherever You go.” 58. Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.” 59. Then He said to another man, “Follow Me.” The man replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” 60. But Jesus told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” 61. Still another said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first let me bid farewell to my family.” 62. Then Jesus declared, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”",
    "1. After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of Him to every town and place He was about to visit. 2. And He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest. 3. Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. 4. Carry no purse or bag or sandals. Do not greet anyone along the road. 5. Whatever house you enter, begin by saying, ‘Peace to this house.’ 6. If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you. 7. Stay at the same house, eating and drinking whatever you are offered. For the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move around from house to house. 8. If you enter a town and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you. 9. Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’ 10. But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go into the streets and declare, 11. ‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a testimony against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.’ 12. I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. 13. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14. But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. 15. And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! 16. Whoever listens to you listens to Me; whoever rejects you rejects Me; and whoever rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.” 17. The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name.” 18. So He told them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 19. Behold, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will harm you. 20. Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.” 21. At that time Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and declared, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight. 22. All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.” 23. Then Jesus turned to the disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. 24. For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.” 25. One day an expert in the law stood up to test Him. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 26. “What is written in the Law?” Jesus replied. “How do you read it?” 27. He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’ and ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ” 28. “You have answered correctly,” Jesus said. “Do this and you will live.” 29. But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 30. Jesus took up this question and said, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. 31. Now by chance a priest was going down the same road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 32. So too, when a Levite came to that spot and saw him, he passed by on the other side. 33. But when a Samaritan on a journey came upon him, he looked at him and had compassion. 34. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 35. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and on my return I will repay you for any additional expense.’ 36. Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” 37. “The one who showed him mercy,” replied the expert in the law. Then Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.” 38. As they traveled along, Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. 39. She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to His message. 40. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations to be made. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me!” 41. “Martha, Martha,” the Lord replied, “you are worried and upset about many things. 42. But only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.”",
    "1. One day in a place where Jesus had just finished praying, one of His disciples requested, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” 2. So Jesus told them, “When you pray, say: 3.  4.  5. Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you goes to his friend at midnight and says, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, 6. because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’ 7. And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Do not bother me. My door is already shut, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.’ 8. I tell you, even though he will not get up to provide for him because of his friendship, yet because of the man’s persistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs. 9. So I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. 10. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. 11. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? 12. Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 13. So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” 14. One day Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. And when the demon was gone, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowds were amazed, 15. but some of them said, “It is by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons, that He drives out demons.” 16. And others tested Him by demanding a sign from heaven. 17. Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and a house divided against a house will fall. 18. If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? After all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. 19. And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. 20. But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. 21. When a strong man, fully armed, guards his house, his possessions are secure. 22. But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted, and then he divides up his plunder. 23. He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. 24. When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ 25. On its return, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. 26. Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and dwell there. And the final plight of that man is worse than the first.” 27. As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said, “Blessed is the womb that bore You, and blessed are the breasts that nursed You!” 28. But He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.” 29. As the crowds were increasing, Jesus said, “This is a wicked generation. It demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. 30. For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation. 31. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here. 32. The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here. 33. No one lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a basket. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light. 34. Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body is full of darkness. 35. Be careful, then, that the light within you is not darkness. 36. So if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, you will be radiant, as though a lamp were shining on you.” 37. As Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee invited Him to dine with him; so He went in and reclined at the table. 38. But the Pharisee was surprised to see that Jesus did not first wash before the meal. 39. “Now then,” said the Lord, “you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. 40. You fools! Did not the One who made the outside make the inside as well? 41. But give as alms the things that are within you, and you will see that everything is clean for you. 42. Woe to you Pharisees! You pay tithes of mint, rue, and every herb, but you disregard justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former. 43. Woe to you Pharisees! You love the chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces. 44. Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without even noticing.” 45. One of the experts in the law told Him, “Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us as well.” 46. “Woe to you as well, experts in the law!” He replied. “You weigh men down with heavy burdens, but you yourselves will not lift a finger to lighten their load. 47. Woe to you! You build tombs for the prophets, but it was your fathers who killed them. 48. So you are witnesses consenting to the deeds of your fathers: They killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. 49. Because of this, the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and others they will persecute.’ 50. As a result, this generation will be charged with the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the foundation of the world, 51. from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, all of it will be charged to this generation. 52. Woe to you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.” 53. As Jesus went on from there, the scribes and Pharisees began to oppose Him bitterly and to ply Him with questions about many things, 54. waiting to catch Him in something He might say.",
    "1. In the meantime, a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling one another. Jesus began to speak first to His disciples: “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 2. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. 3. What you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops. 4. I tell you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. 5. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear the One who, after you have been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear Him! 6. Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. 7. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 8. I tell you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess him before the angels of God. 9. But whoever denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God. 10. And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. 11. When you are brought before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how to defend yourselves or what to say. 12. For at that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you should say.” 13. Someone in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” 14. But Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed Me judge or executor between you?” 15. And He said to them, “Watch out! Guard yourselves against every form of greed, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” 16. Then He told them a parable: “The ground of a certain rich man produced an abundance. 17. So he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, since I have nowhere to store my crops?’ 18. Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and will build bigger ones, and there I will store up all my grain and my goods. 19. Then I will say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and be merry!”’ 20. But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will own what you have accumulated?’ 21. This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.” 22. Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. 23. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. 24. Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storehouse or barn; yet God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than the birds! 25. Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? 26. So if you cannot do such a small thing, why do you worry about the rest? 27. Consider how the lilies grow: They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these. 28. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith! 29. And do not be concerned about what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about it. 30. For the Gentiles of the world strive after all these things, and your Father knows that you need them. 31. But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added unto you. 32. Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom. 33. Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide yourselves with purses that will not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. 34. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 35. Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning. 36. Then you will be like servants waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks, they can open the door for him at once. 37. Blessed are those servants whom the master finds on watch when he returns. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve and will have them recline at the table, and he himself will come and wait on them. 38. Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and finds them alert, those servants will be blessed. 39. But understand this: If the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. 40. You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.” 41. “Lord,” said Peter, “are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone else as well?” 42. And the Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their portion at the proper time? 43. Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. 44. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 45. But suppose that servant says in his heart, ‘My master will be a long time in coming,’ and he begins to beat the menservants and maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk. 46. The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate. Then he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers. 47. That servant who knows his master’s will but does not get ready or follow his instructions will be beaten with many blows. 48. But the one who unknowingly does things worthy of punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and from him who has been entrusted with much, even more will be demanded. 49. I have come to ignite a fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! 50. But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished! 51. Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but division. 52. From now on, five in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three. 53. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ” 54. Then Jesus said to the crowds, “As soon as you see a cloud rising in the west, you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and that is what happens. 55. And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It will be hot,’ and it is. 56. You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and sky. Why don’t you know how to interpret the present time? 57. And why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right? 58. Make every effort to reconcile with your adversary while you are on your way to the magistrate. Otherwise, he may drag you off to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and the officer may throw you into prison. 59. I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the very last penny. ”",
    "1. At that time some of those present told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2. To this He replied, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered this fate? 3. No, I tell you. But unless you repent, you too will all perish. 4. Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam collapsed on them: Do you think that they were more sinful than all the others living in Jerusalem? 5. No, I tell you. But unless you repent, you too will all perish.” 6. Then Jesus told this parable: “A man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any. 7. So he said to the keeper of the vineyard, ‘Look, for the past three years I have come to search for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Therefore cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’ 8. ‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone again this year, until I dig around it and fertilize it. 9. If it bears fruit next year, fine. But if not, you can cut it down.’” 10. One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, 11. and a woman there had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was hunched over and could not stand up straight. 12. When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said, “Woman, you are set free from your disability.” 13. Then He placed His hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and began to glorify God. 14. But the synagogue leader was indignant that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. “There are six days for work,” he told the crowd. “So come and be healed on those days and not on the Sabbath.” 15. “You hypocrites!” the Lord replied. “Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it to water? 16. Then should not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be released from her bondage on the Sabbath day?” 17. When Jesus said this, all His adversaries were humiliated. And the whole crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things He was doing. 18. Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it? 19. It is like a mustard seed that a man tossed into his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.” 20. Again He asked, “To what can I compare the kingdom of God? 21. It is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.” 22. Then Jesus traveled throughout the towns and villages, teaching as He made His way toward Jerusalem. 23. “Lord,” someone asked Him, “will only a few people be saved?” Jesus answered, 24. “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able. 25. After the master of the house gets up and shuts the door, you will stand outside knocking and saying, ‘Lord, open the door for us.’ But he will reply, ‘I do not know where you are from.’ 26. Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’ 27. And he will answer, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers.’ 28. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are thrown out. 29. People will come from east and west and north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God. 30. And indeed, some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.” 31. At that very hour, some Pharisees came to Jesus and told Him, “Leave this place and get away, because Herod wants to kill You.” 32. But Jesus replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘Look, I will keep driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach My goal.’ 33. Nevertheless, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day, for it is not admissible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem. 34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her, how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling! 35. Look, your house is left to you desolate. And I tell you that you will not see Me again until you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’ ”",
    "1. One Sabbath, Jesus went to eat in the home of a leading Pharisee, and those in attendance were watching Him closely. 2. Right there before Him was a man with dropsy. 3. So Jesus asked the experts in the law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?” 4. But they remained silent. Then Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him on his way. 5. And He asked them, “Which of you whose son or ox falls into a pit on the Sabbath day will not immediately pull him out?” 6. And they were unable to answer these questions. 7. When Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, He told them a parable: 8. “When you are invited to a wedding banquet, do not sit in the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited. 9. Then the host who invited both of you will come and tell you, ‘Give this man your seat.’ And in humiliation, you will have to take the last place. 10. But when you are invited, go and sit in the last place, so that your host will come and tell you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in front of everyone at the table with you. 11. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 12. Then Jesus said to the man who had invited Him, “When you host a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you in return, and you will be repaid. 13. But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind, 14. and you will be blessed. Since they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.” 15. When one of those reclining with Him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is everyone who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.” 16. But Jesus replied, “A certain man prepared a great banquet and invited many guests. 17. When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ 18. But one after another they all began to make excuses. The first one said, ‘I have bought a field, and I need to go see it. Please excuse me.’ 19. Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please excuse me.’ 20. Still another said, ‘I have married a wife, so I cannot come.’ 21. The servant returned and reported all this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’ 22. ‘Sir,’ the servant replied, ‘what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’ 23. So the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. 24. For I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.’” 25. Large crowds were now traveling with Jesus, and He turned and said to them, 26. “If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be My disciple. 27. And whoever does not carry his cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple. 28. Which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to see if he has the resources to complete it? 29. Otherwise, if he lays the foundation and is unable to finish the work, everyone who sees it will ridicule him, 30. saying, ‘This man could not finish what he started to build.’ 31. Or what king on his way to war with another king will not first sit down and consider whether he can engage with ten thousand men the one coming against him with twenty thousand? 32. And if he is unable, he will send a delegation while the other king is still far off, to ask for terms of peace. 33. In the same way, any one of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be My disciple. 34. Salt is good, but if the salt loses its savor, with what will it be seasoned? 35. It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile, and it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
    "1. Now all the tax collectors and sinners were gathering around to listen to Jesus. 2. So the Pharisees and scribes began to grumble: “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” 3. Then Jesus told them this parable: 4. “What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the pasture and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? 5. And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders, 6. comes home, and calls together his friends and neighbors to tell them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep!’ 7. In the same way, I tell you that there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous ones who do not need to repent. 8. Or what woman who has ten silver coins and loses one of them does not light a lamp, sweep her house, and search carefully until she finds it? 9. And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors to say, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost coin.’ 10. In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents.” 11. Then Jesus said, “There was a man who had two sons. 12. The younger son said to him, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them. 13. After a few days, the younger son got everything together and journeyed to a distant country, where he squandered his wealth in wild living. 14. After he had spent all he had, a severe famine swept through that country, and he began to be in need. 15. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. 16. He longed to fill his belly with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one would give him a thing. 17. Finally he came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have plenty of food? But here I am, starving to death! 18. I will get up and go back to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. 19. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’ 20. So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still in the distance, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him. 21. The son declared, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’ 22. But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. 23. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let us feast and celebrate. 24. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate. 25. Meanwhile the older son was in the field, and as he approached the house, he heard music and dancing. 26. So he called one of the servants and asked what was going on. 27. ‘Your brother has returned,’ he said, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.’ 28. The older son became angry and refused to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him. 29. But he answered his father, ‘Look, all these years I have served you and never disobeyed a commandment of yours. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. 30. But when this son of yours returns from squandering your wealth with prostitutes, you kill the fattened calf for him!’ 31. ‘Son, you are always with me,’ the father said, ‘and all that is mine is yours. 32. But it was fitting to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”",
    "1. Jesus also said to His disciples, “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. 2. So he called him in to ask, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in an account of your management, for you cannot be manager any longer.’ 3. The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, now that my master is taking away my position? I am too weak to dig and too ashamed to beg. 4. I know what I will do, so that after my removal from management, people will welcome me into their homes.’ 5. And he called in each one of his master’s debtors. ‘How much do you owe my master?’ he asked the first. 6. ‘A hundred measures of olive oil,’ he answered. ‘Take your bill,’ said the manager. ‘Sit down quickly, and write fifty.’ 7. Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ ‘A hundred measures of wheat,’ he replied. ‘Take your bill and write eighty,’ he told him. 8. The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the sons of light. 9. I tell you, use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, they will welcome you into eternal dwellings. 10. Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. 11. So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you with true riches? 12. And if you have not been faithful with the belongings of another, who will give you belongings of your own? 13. No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.” 14. The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all of this and were scoffing at Jesus. 15. So He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is prized among men is detestable before God. 16. The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the gospel of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. 17. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. 18. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 19. Now there was a rich man dressed in purple and fine linen, who lived each day in joyous splendor. 20. And a beggar named Lazarus lay at his gate, covered with sores 21. and longing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. 22. One day the beggar died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. And the rich man also died and was buried. 23. In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham from afar, with Lazarus by his side. 24. So he cried out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. For I am in agony in this fire.’ 25. But Abraham answered, ‘Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things. But now he is comforted here, while you are in agony. 26. And besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that even those who wish cannot cross from here to you, nor can anyone cross from there to us.’ 27. ‘Then I beg you, father,’ he said, ‘send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28. for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also end up in this place of torment.’ 29. But Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let your brothers listen to them.’ 30. ‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone is sent to them from the dead, they will repent.’ 31. Then Abraham said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.’”",
    "1. Jesus said to His disciples, “It is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one through whom they come! 2. It would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. 3. Watch yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. 4. Even if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to say, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.” 5. The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” 6. And the Lord answered, “If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you. 7. Which of you whose servant comes in from plowing or shepherding in the field will say to him, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat’? 8. Instead, won’t he tell him, ‘Prepare my meal and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink’? 9. Does he thank the servant because he did what he was told? 10. So you also, when you have done everything commanded of you, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’” 11. While Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee. 12. As He entered one of the villages, He was met by ten lepers. They stood at a distance 13. and raised their voices, shouting, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” 14. When Jesus saw them, He said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they were on their way, they were cleansed. 15. When one of them saw that he was healed, he came back, praising God in a loud voice. 16. He fell facedown at Jesus’ feet in thanksgiving to Him—and he was a Samaritan. 17. “Were not all ten cleansed?” Jesus asked. “Where then are the other nine? 18. Was no one found except this foreigner to return and give glory to God?” 19. Then Jesus said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well! ” 20. When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, “The kingdom of God will not come with observable signs. 21. Nor will people say, ‘Look, here it is,’ or ‘There it is.’ For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst. ” 22. Then He said to the disciples, “The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. 23. People will tell you, ‘Look, there He is!’ or ‘Look, here He is!’ Do not go out or chase after them. 24. For just as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so will be the Son of Man in His day. 25. But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. 26. Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man: 27. People were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. 28. It was the same in the days of Lot: People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. 29. But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. 30. It will be just like that on the day the Son of Man is revealed. 31. On that day, let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve his possessions. Likewise, let no one in the field return for anything he has left behind. 32. Remember Lot’s wife! 33. Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it. 34. I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed: One will be taken and the other left. 35. Two women will be grinding grain together: One will be taken and the other left.” 37. “Where, Lord?” they asked. Jesus answered, “Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.”",
    "1. Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray at all times and not lose heart: 2. “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected men. 3. And there was a widow in that town who kept appealing to him, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ 4. For a while he refused, but later he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect men, 5. yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will give her justice. Then she will stop wearing me out with her perpetual requests.’” 6. And the Lord said, “Listen to the words of the unjust judge. 7. Will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He continue to defer their help? 8. I tell you, He will promptly carry out justice on their behalf. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?” 9. To some who trusted in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt, He also told this parable: 10. “Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, ‘God, I thank You that I am not like the other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12. I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I acquire.’ 13. But the tax collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven. Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’ 14. I tell you, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 15. Now people were even bringing their babies to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them. And when the disciples saw this, they rebuked those who brought them. 16. But Jesus called the children to Him and said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 17. Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” 18. Then a certain ruler asked Him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 19. “Why do you call Me good?” Jesus replied. “No one is good except God alone. 20. You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother.’ ” 21. “All these I have kept from my youth,” he said. 22. On hearing this, Jesus told him, “You still lack one thing: Sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.” 23. But when the ruler heard this, he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy. 24. Seeing the man’s sadness, Jesus said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! 25. Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” 26. Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?” 27. But Jesus said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.” 28. “Look,” said Peter, “we have left all we had to follow You.” 29. “Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God 30. will fail to receive many times more in this age—and in the age to come, eternal life.” 31. Then Jesus took the Twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything the prophets have written about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. 32. He will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon. 33. They will flog Him and kill Him, and on the third day He will rise again.” 34. But the disciples did not understand any of these things. The meaning was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what He was saying. 35. As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road, begging. 36. When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. 37. “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,” they told him. 38. So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 39. Those who led the way admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 40. Jesus stopped and directed that the man be brought to Him. When he had been brought near, Jesus asked him, 41. “What do you want Me to do for you?” “Lord,” he said, “let me see again.” 42. “Receive your sight!” Jesus replied. “Your faith has healed you.” 43. Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. And all the people who saw this gave praise to God.",
    "1. Then Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. 2. And there was a man named Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector, who was very wealthy. 3. He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd because he was small in stature. 4. So he ran on ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Him, since Jesus was about to pass that way. 5. When Jesus came to that place, He looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, hurry down, for I must stay at your house today.” 6. So Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed Him joyfully. 7. And all who saw this began to grumble, saying, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinful man!” 8. But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone, I will repay it fourfold.” 9. Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham. 10. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” 11. While the people were listening to this, Jesus proceeded to tell them a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they thought the kingdom of God would appear imminently. 12. So He said, “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to lay claim to his kingship and then return. 13. Beforehand, he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Conduct business with this until I return,’ he said. 14. But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to rule over us.’ 15. When he returned from procuring his kingship, he summoned the servants to whom he had given the money, to find out what each one had earned. 16. The first servant came forward and said, ‘Master, your mina has produced ten more minas.’ 17. His master replied, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you shall have authority over ten cities.’ 18. The second servant came and said, ‘Master, your mina has made five minas.’ 19. And to this one he said, ‘You shall have authority over five cities.’ 20. Then another servant came and said, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I have laid away in a piece of cloth. 21. For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’ 22. His master replied, ‘You wicked servant, I will judge you by your own words. So you knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? 23. Why then did you not deposit my money in the bank, and upon my return I could have collected it with interest?’ 24. Then he told those standing by, ‘Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’ 25. ‘Master,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’ 26. He replied, ‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more; but the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 27. And these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them, bring them here and slay them in front of me.’” 28. After Jesus had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. 29. As He approached Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples, 30. saying, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. 31. If anyone asks, ‘Why are you untying it?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it.’” 32. So those who were sent went out and found it just as Jesus had told them. 33. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked, “Why are you untying the colt?” 34. “The Lord needs it,” they answered. 35. Then they led the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and put Jesus on it. 36. As He rode along, the people spread their cloaks on the road. 37. And as He approached the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of disciples began to praise God joyfully in a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen: 38.  39. But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!” 40. “I tell you,” He answered, “if they remain silent, the very stones will cry out.” 41. As Jesus approached Jerusalem and saw the city, He wept over it 42. and said, “If only you had known on this day what would bring you peace! But now it is hidden from your eyes. 43. For the days will come upon you when your enemies will barricade you and surround you and hem you in on every side. 44. They will level you to the ground—you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God. ” 45. Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling there. 46. He declared to them, “It is written: ‘My house will be a house of prayer.’ But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’ ” 47. Jesus was teaching at the temple every day, but the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were intent on killing Him. 48. Yet they could not find a way to do so, because all the people hung on His words.",
    "1. One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and scribes, together with the elders, came up to Him. 2. “Tell us,” they said, “by what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?” 3. “I will also ask you a question,” Jesus replied. “Tell Me: 4. John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?” 5. They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why did you not believe him?’ 6. But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.” 7. So they answered that they did not know where it was from. 8. And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.” 9. Then He proceeded to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to some tenants, and went away for a long time. 10. At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed. 11. So he sent another servant, but they beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him away empty-handed. 12. Then he sent a third, but they wounded him and threw him out. 13. ‘What shall I do?’ asked the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’ 14. But when the tenants saw the son, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ 15. So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? 16. He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others.” And when the people heard this, they said, “May such a thing never happen!” 17. But Jesus looked directly at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: 18. Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.” 19. When the scribes and chief priests realized that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought to arrest Him that very hour. But they were afraid of the people. 20. So they watched Him closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch Him in His words in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor. 21. “Teacher,” they inquired, “we know that You speak and teach correctly. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. 22. Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” 23. But Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them, 24. “Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” “Caesar’s,” they answered. 25. So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” 26. And they were unable to trap Him in His words before the people; and amazed at His answer, they fell silent. 27. Then some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to question Him. 28. “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him. 29. Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a wife, but died childless. 30. Then the second 31. and the third married the widow, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children. 32. And last of all, the woman died. 33. So then, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.” 34. Jesus answered, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage. 35. But those who are considered worthy to share in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage. 36. In fact, they can no longer die, because they are like the angels. And since they are sons of the resurrection, they are sons of God. 37. Even Moses demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ 38. He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.” 39. Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, You have spoken well!” 40. And they did not dare to question Him any further. 41. Then Jesus declared, “How can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David? 42. For David himself says in the book of Psalms: 43.  44. Thus David calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?” 45. In the hearing of all the people, Jesus said to His disciples, 46. “Beware of the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, and they love the greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets. 47. They defraud widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.”",
    "1. Then Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, 2. and He saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. 3. “Truly I tell you,” He said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others. 4. For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.” 5. As some of the disciples were remarking how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated gifts, Jesus said, 6. “As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.” 7. “Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?” 8. Jesus answered, “See to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them. 9. When you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be alarmed. These things must happen first, but the end is not imminent.” 10. Then He told them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 11. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, along with fearful sights and great signs from heaven. 12. But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring you before kings and governors. 13. This will be your opportunity to serve as witnesses. 14. So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how to defend yourselves. 15. For I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. 16. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death. 17. And you will be hated by everyone because of My name. 18. Yet not even a hair of your head will perish. 19. By your patient endurance you will gain your souls. 20. But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is near. 21. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of the city. 22. For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. 23. How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people. 24. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. 25. There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves. 26. Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 27. At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28. When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.” 29. Then Jesus told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. 30. When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. 31. So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. 32. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened. 33. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away. 34. But watch yourselves, or your hearts will be weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness, and the worries of life—and that day will spring upon you suddenly like a snare. 35. For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of all the earth. 36. So keep watch at all times, and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man.” 37. Every day Jesus taught at the temple, but every evening He went out to spend the night on the Mount of Olives. 38. And early in the morning all the people would come to hear Him at the temple.",
    "1. Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, 2. and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death; for they feared the people. 3. Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve. 4. And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them. 5. They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 6. Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd. 7. Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed. 8. Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare for us to eat the Passover.” 9. “Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked. 10. He answered, “When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters, 11. and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’ 12. And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.” 13. So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover. 14. When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles. 15. And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering. 16. For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 17. After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves. 18. For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.” 19. And He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” 20. In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you. 21. Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table. 22. Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.” 23. Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this. 24. A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them would be considered the greatest. 25. So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors. 26. But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. 27. For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves. 28. You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials. 29. And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me, 30. so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 31. Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat. 32. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” 33. “Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.” 34. But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.” 35. Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered. 36. “Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one. 37. For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.” 38. So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered. 39. Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him. 40. When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.” 41. And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed, 42. “Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.” 43. Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him. 44. And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. 45. When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. 46. “Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.” 47. While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him. 48. But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” 49. Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” 50. And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. 51. But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him. 52. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw? 53. Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.” 54. Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance. 55. When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. 56. A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said. 57. But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said. 58. A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” 59. About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.” 60. “Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. While he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. 61. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.” 62. And he went outside and wept bitterly. 63. The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him. 64. They blindfolded Him and kept demanding, “Prophesy! Who hit You?” 65. And they said many other blasphemous things against Him. 66. At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin and said, 67. “If You are the Christ, tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe. 68. And if I ask you a question, you will not answer. 69. But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” 70. So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that I am.” 71. “Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”",
    "1. Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate. 2. And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.” 3. So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied. 4. Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” 5. But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.” 6. When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 7. And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time. 8. When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle. 9. Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer. 10. Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him. 11. And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate. 12. That day Herod and Pilate became friends; before this time they had been enemies. 13. Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, 14. and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined Him here in your presence and found Him not guilty of your charges against Him. 15. Neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us. As you can see, He has done nothing deserving of death. 16. Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.” 18. But they all cried out in unison: “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!” 19. (Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.) 20. Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed them again, 21. but they kept shouting, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” 22. A third time he said to them, “What evil has this man done? I have found in Him no offense worthy of death. So after I punish Him, I will release Him.” 23. But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices for Jesus to be crucified. And their clamor prevailed. 24. So Pilate sentenced that their demand be met. 25. As they had requested, he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and handed Jesus over to their will. 26. As the soldiers led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus. 27. A great number of people followed Him, including women who kept mourning and wailing for Him. 28. But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 29. Look, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore, and breasts that never nursed!’ 30. At that time 31. For if men do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?” 32. Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus. 33. When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left. 34. Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up His garments by casting lots. 35. The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.” 36. The soldiers also mocked Him and came up to offer Him sour wine. 37. “If You are the King of the Jews,” they said, “save Yourself!” 38. Above Him was posted an inscription: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 39. One of the criminals who hung there heaped abuse on Him. “Are You not the Christ?” he said. “Save Yourself and us!” 40. But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment? 41. We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our actions deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.” 42. Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!” 43. And Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.” 44. It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour. 45. The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle. 46. Then Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit.” And when He had said this, He breathed His last. 47. When the centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, “Surely this was a righteous man. ” 48. And when all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts. 49. But all those who knew Jesus, including the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching these things. 50. Now there was a Council member named Joseph, a good and righteous man, 51. who had not consented to their decision or action. He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and was waiting for the kingdom of God. 52. He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus. 53. Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had yet been laid. 54. It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was beginning. 55. The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was placed. 56. Then they returned to prepare spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.",
    "1. On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared. 2. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 3. but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4. While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them. 5. As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? 6. He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee: 7. ‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’” 8. Then they remembered His words. 9. And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. 10. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. 11. But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women. 12. Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. 13. That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. 14. They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. 15. And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them. 16. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. 17. He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?” They stood still, with sadness on their faces. 18. One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?” 19. “What things?” He asked. “The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people. 20. Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him. 21. But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place. 22. Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, 23. but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive. 24. Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.” 25. Then Jesus said to them, “O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26. Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?” 27. And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself. 28. As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther. 29. But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” So He went in to stay with them. 30. While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them. 31. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight. 32. They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” 33. And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together 34. and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!” 35. Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread. 36. While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” 37. But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit. 38. “Why are you troubled,” Jesus asked, “and why do doubts arise in your hearts? 39. Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” 40. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet. 41. While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” 42. So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish, 43. and He took it and ate it in front of them. 44. Jesus said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.” 45. Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. 46. And He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, 47. and in His name repentance and forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem. 48. You are witnesses of these things. 49. And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But remain in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.” 50. When Jesus had led them out as far as Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them. 51. While He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven. 52. And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 53. praising God continually in the temple."

  "John": [
    "1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2. He was with God in the beginning. 3. Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made. 4. In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. 5. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6. There came a man who was sent from God. His name was John. 7. He came as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe. 8. He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light. 9. The true Light who gives light to every man was coming into the world. 10. He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. 11. He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 12. But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God— 13. children born not of blood, nor of the desire or will of man, but born of God. 14. The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15. John testified concerning Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’” 16. From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace. 17. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18. No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is at the Father’s side, has made Him known. 19. And this was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?” 20. He did not refuse to confess, but openly declared, “I am not the Christ.” 21. “Then who are you?” they inquired. “Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.” 22. So they said to him, “Who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 23. John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet: 24. Then the Pharisees who had been sent 25. asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 26. “I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands One you do not know. 27. He is the One who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” 28. All this happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 29. The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 30. This is He of whom I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’ 31. I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel.” 32. Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and resting on Him. 33. I myself did not know Him, but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is He who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ 34. I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God. ” 35. The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. 36. When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” 37. And when the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. 38. Jesus turned and saw them following. “What do you want?” He asked. They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?” 39. “Come and see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour. 40. Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John’s testimony and followed Jesus. 41. He first found his brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated as Christ). 42. Andrew brought him to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated as Peter). 43. The next day Jesus decided to set out for Galilee. Finding Philip, He told him, “Follow Me.” 44. Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter. 45. Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, the One the prophets foretold—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 46. “Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip. 47. When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit.” 48. “How do You know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.” 49. “Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” 50. Jesus said to him, “Do you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.” 51. Then He declared, “Truly, truly, I tell you, you will all see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”",
    "1. On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, 2. and Jesus and His disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 3. When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They have no more wine.” 4. “Woman, why does this concern us?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.” 5. His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.” 6. Now six stone water jars had been set there for the Jewish rites of purification. Each could hold from twenty to thirty gallons. 7. Jesus told the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim. 8. “Now draw some out,” He said, “and take it to the master of the banquet.” They did so, 9. and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know where it was from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 10. and said, “Everyone serves the fine wine first, and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk. But you have saved the fine wine until now!” 11. Jesus performed this, the first of His signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him. 12. After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and His disciples, and they stayed there a few days. 13. When the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14. In the temple courts He found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers seated at their tables. 15. So He made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle. He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 16. To those selling doves He said, “Get these out of here! How dare you turn My Father’s house into a marketplace!” 17. His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.” 18. On account of this, the Jews demanded, “What sign can You show us to prove Your authority to do these things?” 19. Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.” 20. “This temple took forty-six years to build,” the Jews replied, “and You are going to raise it up in three days?” 21. But Jesus was speaking about the temple of His body. 22. After He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken. 23. While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the signs He was doing and believed in His name. 24. But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew them all. 25. He did not need any testimony about man, for He knew what was in a man.",
    "1. Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. 2. He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him.” 3. Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. ” 4. “How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time to be born?” 5. Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 6. Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is born of the Spirit. 7. Do not be amazed that I said, ‘You must be born again.’ 8. The wind blows where it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.” 9. “How can this be?” Nicodemus asked. 10. “You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and you do not understand these things? 11. Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and yet you people do not accept our testimony. 12. If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? 13. No one has ascended into heaven except the One who descended from heaven—the Son of Man. 14. Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15. that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life. 16. For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. 18. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19. And this is the verdict: The Light has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil. 20. Everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come into the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21. But whoever practices the truth comes into the Light, so that it may be seen clearly that what he has done has been accomplished in God.” 22. After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent some time with them and baptized. 23. Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because the water was plentiful there, and people kept coming to be baptized. 24. (For John had not yet been thrown into prison.) 25. Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the issue of ceremonial washing. 26. So John’s disciples came to him and said, “Look, Rabbi, the One who was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about—He is baptizing, and everyone is going to Him.” 27. John replied, “A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. 28. You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but am sent ahead of Him.’ 29. The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens for him, and is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. 30. He must increase; I must decrease. 31. The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The One who comes from heaven is above all. 32. He testifies to what He has seen and heard, yet no one accepts His testimony. 33. Whoever accepts His testimony has certified that God is truthful. 34. For the One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. 35. The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in His hands. 36. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. Whoever rejects the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.”",
    "1. When Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John 2. (although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples), 3. He left Judea and returned to Galilee. 4. Now He had to pass through Samaria. 5. So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 6. Since Jacob’s well was there, Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 7. When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” 8. (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) 9. “You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) 10. Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.” 11. “Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will You get this living water? 12. Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?” 13. Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again. 14. But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.” 15. The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.” 16. Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.” 17. “I have no husband,” the woman replied. Jesus said to her, “You are correct to say that you have no husband. 18. In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.” 19. “Sir,” the woman said, “I see that You are a prophet. 20. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.” 21. “Believe Me, woman,” Jesus replied, “a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 22. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. 23. But a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him. 24. God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in truth.” 25. The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.” 26. Jesus answered, “I who speak to you am He.” 27. Just then His disciples returned and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him, “What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?” 28. Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people, 29. “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?” 30. So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus. 31. Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.” 32. But He told them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” 33. So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought Him food?” 34. Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work. 35. Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe for harvest. 36. Already the reaper draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. 37. For in this case the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true. 38. I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the hard work, and now you have taken up their labor.” 39. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” 40. So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed two days. 41. And many more believed because of His message. 42. They said to the woman, “We now believe not only because of your words; we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the Savior of the world.” 43. After two days, Jesus left for Galilee. 44. Now He Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown. 45. Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well. 46. So once again He came to Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. 47. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die. 48. Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.” 49. “Sir,” the official said, “come down before my child dies.” 50. “Go,” said Jesus. “Your son will live.” The man took Jesus at His word and departed. 51. And while he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive. 52. So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour. ” 53. Then the father realized that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” And he and all his household believed. 54. This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee.",
    "1. Some time later there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 2. Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew is called Bethesda. 3. On these walkways lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed. 5. One man there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 6. When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that he had spent a long time in this condition, He asked him, “Do you want to get well?” 7. “Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.” 8. Then Jesus told him, “Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.” 9. Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk. Now this happened on the Sabbath day, 10. so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.” 11. But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” 12. “Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked. 13. But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there. 14. Afterward, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.” 15. And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. 16. Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute Him. 17. But Jesus answered them, “To this very day My Father is at His work, and I too am working.” 18. Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. 19. So Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does. 20. The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does. And to your amazement, He will show Him even greater works than these. 21. For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes. 22. Furthermore, the Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son, 23. so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. 24. Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life. 25. Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. 26. For as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself. 27. And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man. 28. Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice 29. and come out—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment. 30. I can do nothing by Myself; I judge only as I hear. And My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me. 31. If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not valid. 32. There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that His testimony about Me is valid. 33. You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. 34. Even though I do not accept human testimony, I say these things so that you may be saved. 35. John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you were willing for a season to bask in his light. 36. But I have testimony more substantial than that of John. For the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works I am doing—testify about Me that the Father has sent Me. 37. And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form, 38. nor does His word abide in you, because you do not believe the One He sent. 39. You pore over the Scriptures because you presume that by them you possess eternal life. These are the very words that testify about Me, 40. yet you refuse to come to Me to have life. 41. I do not accept glory from men, 42. but I know you, that you do not have the love of God within you. 43. I have come in My Father’s name, and you have not received Me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will receive him. 44. How can you believe if you accept glory from one another, yet do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? 45. Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. 46. If you had believed Moses, you would believe Me, because he wrote about Me. 47. But since you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?”",
    "1. After this, Jesus crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias). 2. A large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was performing on the sick. 3. Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples. 4. Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near. 5. When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?” 6. But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do. 7. Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.” 8. One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him, 9. “Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?” 10. “Have the people sit down,” Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them. 11. Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. 12. And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.” 13. So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. 14. When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.” 15. Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and make Him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by Himself. 16. When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, 17. got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet gone out to them. 18. A strong wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated. 19. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the sea—and they were terrified. 20. But Jesus spoke up: “It is I; do not be afraid.” 21. Then they were willing to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading. 22. The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone. 23. However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 24. So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Him. 25. When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?” 26. Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. 27. Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.” 28. Then they inquired, “What must we do to perform the works of God?” 29. Jesus replied, “The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.” 30. So they asked Him, “What sign then will You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do? 31. Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ” 32. Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. 33. For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34. “Sir,” they said, “give us this bread at all times.” 35. Jesus answered, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst. 36. But as I stated, you have seen Me and still you do not believe. 37. Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away. 38. For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me. 39. And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day. 40. For it is My Father’s will that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.” 41. At this, the Jews began to grumble about Jesus because He had said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” 42. They were asking, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, ‘I have come down from heaven?’” 43. “Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus replied. 44. “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. 45. It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me— 46. not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the Father. 47. Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life. 48. I am the bread of life. 49. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. 50. This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die. 51. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.” 52. At this, the Jews began to argue among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?” 53. So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, you have no life in you. 54. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. 55. For My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink. 56. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him. 57. Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me. 58. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your fathers, who ate the manna and died, the one who eats this bread will live forever.” 59. Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. 60. On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?” 61. Aware that His disciples were grumbling about this teaching, Jesus asked them, “Does this offend you? 62. Then what will happen if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before? 63. The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. 64. However, there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray Him.) 65. Then Jesus said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless the Father has granted it to him.” 66. From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him. 67. So Jesus asked the Twelve, “Do you want to leave too?” 68. Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69. We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God. ” 70. Jesus answered them, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!” 71. He was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For although Judas was one of the Twelve, he was later to betray Jesus.",
    "1. After this, Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jews there were trying to kill Him. 2. However, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near. 3. So Jesus’ brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing. 4. For no one who wants to be known publicly acts in secret. Since You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.” 5. For even His own brothers did not believe in Him. 6. Therefore Jesus told them, “Although your time is always at hand, My time has not yet come. 7. The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify that its works are evil. 8. Go up to the feast on your own. I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet come.” 9. Having said this, Jesus remained in Galilee. 10. But after His brothers had gone up to the feast, He also went—not publicly, but in secret. 11. So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and asking, “Where is He?” 12. Many in the crowds were whispering about Him. Some said, “He is a good man.” But others replied, “No, He deceives the people.” 13. Yet no one would speak publicly about Him for fear of the Jews. 14. About halfway through the feast, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach. 15. The Jews were amazed and asked, “How did this man attain such learning without having studied?” 16. “My teaching is not My own,” Jesus replied. “It comes from Him who sent Me. 17. If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own. 18. He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth; in Him there is no falsehood. 19. Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?” 20. “You have a demon,” the crowd replied. “Who is trying to kill You?” 21. Jesus answered them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. 22. But because Moses gave you circumcision, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs.) 23. If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken, why are you angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath? 24. Stop judging by outward appearances, and start judging justly.” 25. Then some of the people of Jerusalem began to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill? 26. Yet here He is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying anything to Him. Have the rulers truly recognized that this is the Christ? 27. But we know where this man is from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.” 28. Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “You know Me, and you know where I am from. I have not come of My own accord, but He who sent Me is true. You do not know Him, 29. but I know Him, because I am from Him and He sent Me.” 30. So they tried to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. 31. Many in the crowd, however, believed in Him and said, “When the Christ comes, will He perform more signs than this man?” 32. When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus, they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him. 33. So Jesus said, “I am with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One who sent Me. 34. You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.” 35. At this, the Jews said to one another, “Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him? Will He go where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 36. What does He mean by saying, ‘You will look for Me, but you will not find Me,’ and, ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?” 37. On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and called out in a loud voice, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. 38. Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said: ‘Streams of living water will flow from within him.’” 39. He was speaking about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were later to receive. For the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. 40. On hearing these words, some of the people said, “This is truly the Prophet.” 41. Others declared, “This is the Christ.” But still others asked, “How can the Christ come from Galilee? 42. Doesn’t the Scripture say that the Christ will come from the line of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived? ” 43. So there was division in the crowd because of Jesus. 44. Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him. 45. Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Him in?” 46. “Never has anyone spoken like this man!” the officers answered. 47. “Have you also been deceived?” replied the Pharisees. 48. “Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him? 49. But this crowd that does not know the law, they are under a curse.” 50. Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who himself was one of them, asked, 51. “Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to determine what he has done?” 52. “Aren’t you also from Galilee?” they replied. “Look into it, and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.” 53. Then each went to his own home.",
    "1. But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2. Early in the morning He went back into the temple courts. All the people came to Him, and He sat down to teach them. 3. The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them 4. and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5. In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?” 6. They said this to test Him, in order to have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with His finger. 7. When they continued to question Him, He straightened up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.” 8. And again He bent down and wrote on the ground. 9. When they heard this, they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there. 10. Then Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?” 11. “No one, Lord,” she answered. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Now go and sin no more.” 12. Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.” 13. So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.” 14. Jesus replied, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going. 15. You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. 16. But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone; I am with the Father who sent Me. 17. Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid. 18. I am One who testifies about Myself, and the Father, who sent Me, also testifies about Me.” 19. “Where is Your Father?” they asked Him. “You do not know Me or My Father,” Jesus answered. “If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.” 20. He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come. 21. Again He said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.” 22. So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?” 23. Then He told them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. 24. That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.” 25. “Who are You?” they asked. “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied. 26. “I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.” 27. They did not understand that He was telling them about the Father. 28. So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me. 29. He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.” 30. As Jesus spoke these things, many believed in Him. 31. So He said to the Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples. 32. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” 33. “We are Abraham’s descendants,” they answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can You say we will be set free?” 34. Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. 35. A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son belongs to it forever. 36. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. 37. I know you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My word has no place within you. 38. I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.” 39. “Abraham is our father,” they replied. “If you were children of Abraham,” said Jesus, “you would do the works of Abraham. 40. But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing. 41. You are doing the works of your father.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.” 42. Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me. 43. Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept My message. 44. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies. 45. But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me! 46. Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me? 47. Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.” 48. The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right to say that You are a Samaritan and You have a demon?” 49. “I do not have a demon,” Jesus replied, “but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. 50. I do not seek My own glory. There is One who seeks it, and He is the Judge. 51. Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.” 52. “Now we know that You have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet You say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death. 53. Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do You claim to be?” 54. Jesus answered, “If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. The One who glorifies Me is My Father, of whom you say ‘He is our God.’ 55. You do not know Him, but I know Him. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word. 56. Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it and was glad.” 57. Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?” 58. “Truly, truly, I tell you,” Jesus declared, “before Abraham was born, I am! ” 59. At this, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple area.",
    "1. Now as Jesus was passing by, He saw a man blind from birth, 2. and His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 3. Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God would be displayed in him. 4. While it is daytime, we must do the works of Him who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work. 5. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” 6. When Jesus had said this, He spit on the ground, made some mud, and applied it to the man’s eyes. 7. Then He told him, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing. 8. At this, his neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?” 9. Some claimed that he was, but others said, “No, he just looks like him.” But the man kept saying, “I am the one.” 10. “How then were your eyes opened?” they asked. 11. He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and anointed my eyes, and He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight.” 12. “Where is He?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered. 13. They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. 14. Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath. 15. So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. The man answered, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.” 16. Because of this, some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was division among them. 17. So once again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?” “He is a prophet,” the man replied. 18. The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his parents 19. and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? So how is it that he can now see?” 20. His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and we know he was born blind. 21. But how he can now see or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.” 22. His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. 23. That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.” 24. So a second time they called for the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.” 25. He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!” 26. “What did He do to you?” they asked. “How did He open your eyes?” 27. He replied, “I already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?” 28. Then they heaped insults on him and said, “You are His disciple; we are disciples of Moses. 29. We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.” 30. “That is remarkable indeed!” the man said. “You do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes. 31. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but He does listen to the one who worships Him and does His will. 32. Never before has anyone heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. 33. If this man were not from God, He could do no such thing.” 34. They replied, “You were born in utter sin, and you are instructing us?” And they threw him out. 35. When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, He found the man and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man ?” 36. “Who is He, Sir?” he replied. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.” 37. “You have already seen Him,” Jesus answered. “He is the One speaking with you.” 38. “Lord, I believe,” he said. And he worshiped Jesus. 39. Then Jesus declared, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and those who see may become blind.” 40. Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?” 41. “If you were blind,” Jesus replied, “you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, your guilt remains.”",
    "1. “Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber. 2. But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. 3. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. 5. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice.” 6. Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them. 7. So He said to them again, “Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. 8. All who came before Me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. 9. I am the gate. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture. 10. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness. 11. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. 12. The hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock. 13. The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep. 14. I am the good shepherd. I know My sheep and My sheep know Me, 15. just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep. 16. I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as well, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd. 17. The reason the Father loves Me is that I lay down My life in order to take it up again. 18. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from My Father.” 19. Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message. 20. Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?” 21. But others replied, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” 22. At that time the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, 23. and Jesus was walking in the temple courts in Solomon’s Colonnade. 24. So the Jews gathered around Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.” 25. “I already told you,” Jesus replied, “but you did not believe. The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My behalf. 26. But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe. 27. My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me. 28. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them out of My hand. 29. My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand. 30. I and the Father are one.” 31. At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone Him. 32. But Jesus responded, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?” 33. “We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.” 34. Jesus replied, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’ ? 35. If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken— 36. then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God? 37. If I am not doing the works of My Father, then do not believe Me. 38. But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.” 39. At this, they tried again to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp. 40. Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing, and He stayed there. 41. Many came to Him and said, “Although John never performed a sign, everything he said about this man was true.” 42. And many in that place believed in Jesus.",
    "1. At this time a man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 2. (Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet with her hair.) 3. So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.” 4. When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” 5. Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6. So on hearing that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days, 7. and then He said to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.” 8. “Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?” 9. Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world. 10. But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.” 11. After He had said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.” 12. His disciples replied, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.” 13. They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus. 14. So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, 15. and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” 16. Then Thomas called Didymus said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.” 17. When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already spent four days in the tomb. 18. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, a little less than two miles away, 19. and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them in the loss of their brother. 20. So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary stayed at home. 21. Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 22. But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask of Him.” 23. “Your brother will rise again,” Jesus told her. 24. Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” 25. Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies. 26. And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?” 27. “Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.” 28. After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.” 29. And when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him. 30. Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him. 31. When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. 32. When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.” 33. When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. 34. “Where have you put him?” He asked. “Come and see, Lord,” they answered. 35. Jesus wept. 36. Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!” 37. But some of them asked, “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have kept Lazarus from dying?” 38. Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. 39. “Take away the stone,” Jesus said. “Lord, by now he stinks,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man. “It has already been four days.” 40. Jesus replied, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” 41. So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. 42. I knew that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that You sent Me.” 43. After Jesus had said this, He called out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” 44. The man who had been dead came out with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen, and his face wrapped in a cloth. “Unwrap him and let him go,” Jesus told them. 45. Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him. 46. But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47. Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs. 48. If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” 49. But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all! 50. You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.” 51. Caiaphas did not say this on his own. Instead, as high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation, 52. and not only for the nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to gather them together into one. 53. So from that day on they plotted to kill Him. 54. As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples. 55. Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover. 56. They kept looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple courts, “What do you think? Will He come to the feast at all?” 57. But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where He was must report it, so that they could arrest Him.",
    "1. Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, the hometown of Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. 2. So they hosted a dinner for Jesus there. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with Him. 3. Then Mary took about a pint of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 4. But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray Him, asked, 5. “Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?” 6. Judas did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it. 7. “Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “She has kept this perfume in preparation for the day of My burial. 8. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me.” 9. Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews learned that Jesus was there. And they came not only because of Him, but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. 10. So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, 11. for on account of him many of the Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus. 12. The next day the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 13. They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, shouting: 14. Finding a young donkey, Jesus sat on it, as it is written: 15.  16. At first His disciples did not understand these things, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered what had been done to Him, and they realized that these very things had also been written about Him. 17. Meanwhile, many people continued to testify that they had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead. 18. That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. 19. Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole world has gone after Him!” 20. Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast. 21. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” 22. Philip relayed this appeal to Andrew, and both of them went and told Jesus. 23. But Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 24. Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a seed; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. 25. Whoever loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 26. If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, My servant will be as well. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him. 27. Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour. 28. Father, glorify Your name!” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” 29. The crowd standing there heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to Him. 30. In response, Jesus said, “This voice was not for My benefit, but yours. 31. Now judgment is upon this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out. 32. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to Myself.” 33. He said this to indicate the kind of death He was going to die. 34. The crowd replied, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever. So how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” 35. Then Jesus told them, “For a little while longer, the Light will be among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. 36. While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of light.” After Jesus had spoken these things, He went away and was hidden from them. 37. Although Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in Him. 38. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: 39. For this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says: 40.  41. Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about Him. 42. Nevertheless, many of the leaders believed in Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue. 43. For they loved praise from men more than praise from God. 44. Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in Me does not believe in Me alone, but in the One who sent Me. 45. And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me. 46. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Me should remain in darkness. 47. As for anyone who hears My words and does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world. 48. There is a judge for the one who rejects Me and does not receive My words: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. 49. I have not spoken on My own, but the Father who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and how to say it. 50. And I know that His command leads to eternal life. So I speak exactly what the Father has told Me to say.”",
    "1. It was now just before the Passover Feast, and Jesus knew that His hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the very end. 2. The evening meal was underway, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. 3. Jesus knew that the Father had delivered all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God. 4. So He got up from the supper, laid aside His outer garments, and wrapped a towel around His waist. 5. After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry them with the towel that was around Him. 6. He came to Simon Peter, who asked Him, “Lord, are You going to wash my feet?” 7. Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” 8. “Never shall You wash my feet!” Peter told Him. Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.” 9. “Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!” 10. Jesus told him, “Whoever has already bathed needs only to wash his feet, and he will be completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” 11. For He knew who would betray Him. That is why He said, “Not all of you are clean.” 12. When Jesus had washed their feet and put on His outer garments, He reclined with them again and asked, “Do you know what I have done for you? 13. You call Me Teacher and Lord, and rightly so, because I am. 14. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. 15. I have set you an example so that you should do as I have done for you. 16. Truly, truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. 17. If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. 18. I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: ‘The one who shares My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.’ 19. I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it comes to pass, you will believe that I am He. 20. Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever receives the one I send receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives the One who sent Me.” 21. After Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit and testified, “Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.” 22. The disciples looked at one another, perplexed as to which of them He meant. 23. One of His disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining at His side. 24. So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus which one He was talking about. 25. Leaning back against Jesus, he asked, “Lord, who is it?” 26. Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.” Then He dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. 27. And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to Judas, “What you are about to do, do quickly.” 28. But no one at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him. 29. Since Judas kept the money bag, some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor. 30. As soon as he had received the morsel, Judas went out into the night. 31. When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him. 32. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify the Son in Himself—and will glorify Him at once. 33. Little children, I am with you only a little while longer. You will look for Me, and as I said to the Jews, so now I say to you: ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’ 34. A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also must love one another. 35. By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another.” 36. “Lord, where are You going?” Simon Peter asked. Jesus answered, “Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now, but you will follow later.” 37. “Lord,” said Peter, “why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.” 38. “Will you lay down your life for Me?” Jesus replied. “Truly, truly, I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.",
    "1. “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe in Me as well. 2. In My Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 3. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My presence, so that you also may be where I am. 4. You know the way to the place where I am going. ” 5. “Lord,” said Thomas, “we do not know where You are going, so how can we know the way?” 6. Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. 7. If you had known Me, you would know My Father as well. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.” 8. Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.” 9. Jesus replied, “Philip, I have been with you all this time, and still you do not know Me? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 10. Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own. Instead, it is the Father dwelling in Me, performing His works. 11. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me—or at least believe on account of the works themselves. 12. Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes in Me will also do the works that I am doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13. And I will do whatever you ask in My name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14. If you ask Me for anything in My name, I will do it. 15. If you love Me, you will keep My commandments. 16. And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate to be with you forever— 17. the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive Him, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you. 18. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 19. In a little while the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you also will live. 20. On that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you. 21. Whoever has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me. The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and reveal Myself to him.” 22. Judas (not Iscariot) asked Him, “Lord, why are You going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?” 23. Jesus replied, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. 24. Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words. The word that you hear is not My own, but it is from the Father who sent Me. 25. All this I have spoken to you while I am still with you. 26. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have told you. 27. Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled; do not be afraid. 28. You heard Me say, ‘I am going away, and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I. 29. And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you will believe. 30. I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming, and he has no claim on Me. 31. But I do exactly what the Father has commanded Me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Get up! Let us go on from here.",
    "1. “I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard. 2. He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful. 3. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. 4. Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. 5. I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing. 6. If anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned. 7. If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8. This is to My Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples. 9. As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love. 10. If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and remain in His love. 11. I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete. 12. This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 13. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. 14. You are My friends if you do what I command you. 15. No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you. 16. You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you. 17. This is My command to you: Love one another. 18. If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first. 19. If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. 20. Remember the word that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept My word, they will keep yours as well. 21. But they will treat you like this because of My name, since they do not know the One who sent Me. 22. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. 23. Whoever hates Me hates My Father as well. 24. If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father. 25. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without reason.’ 26. When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will testify about Me. 27. And you also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.",
    "1. “I have told you these things so that you will not fall away. 2. They will put you out of the synagogues. In fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God. 3. They will do these things because they have not known the Father or Me. 4. But I have told you these things so that when their hour comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you. 5. Now, however, I am going to Him who sent Me; yet none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’ 6. Instead, your hearts are filled with sorrow because I have told you these things. 7. But I tell you the truth, it is for your benefit that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you. 8. And when He comes, He will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: 9. in regard to sin, because they do not believe in Me; 10. in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me; 11. and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world has been condemned. 12. I still have much to tell you, but you cannot yet bear to hear it. 13. However, when the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all truth. For He will not speak on His own, but He will speak what He hears, and He will declare to you what is to come. 14. He will glorify Me by taking from what is Mine and disclosing it to you. 15. Everything that belongs to the Father is Mine. That is why I said that the Spirit will take from what is Mine and disclose it to you. 16. In a little while you will see Me no more, and then after a little while you will see Me. ” 17. Then some of His disciples asked one another, “Why is He telling us, ‘In a little while you will not see Me, and then after a little while you will see Me’ and ‘Because I am going to the Father’?” 18. They kept asking, “Why is He saying, ‘a little while’? We do not understand what He is saying.” 19. Aware that they wanted to question Him, Jesus said to them, “Are you asking one another why I said, ‘In a little while you will not see Me, and then after a little while you will see Me’? 20. Truly, truly, I tell you, you will weep and wail while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. 21. A woman has pain in childbirth because her time has come; but when she brings forth her child, she forgets her anguish because of her joy that a child has been born into the world. 22. So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. 23. In that day you will no longer ask Me anything. Truly, truly, I tell you, whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you. 24. Until now you have not asked for anything in My name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. 25. I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you this way, but will tell you plainly about the Father. 26. In that day you will ask in My name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. 27. For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came from God. 28. I came from the Father and entered the world. In turn, I will leave the world and go to the Father.” 29. His disciples said, “See, now You are speaking plainly and without figures of speech. 30. Now we understand that You know all things and that You have no need for anyone to question You. Because of this, we believe that You came from God.” 31. “Do you finally believe?” Jesus replied. 32. “Look, an hour is coming and has already come when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and you will leave Me all alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. 33. I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage; I have overcome the world!”",
    "1. When Jesus had spoken these things, He lifted up His eyes to heaven and said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You. 2. For You granted Him authority over all people, so that He may give eternal life to all those You have given Him. 3. Now this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent. 4. I have glorified You on earth by accomplishing the work You gave Me to do. 5. And now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence with the glory I had with You before the world existed. 6. I have revealed Your name to those You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours; You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. 7. Now they know that everything You have given Me comes from You. 8. For I have given them the words You gave Me, and they have received them. They knew with certainty that I came from You, and they believed that You sent Me. 9. I ask on their behalf. I do not ask on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those You have given Me; for they are Yours. 10. All I have is Yours, and all You have is Mine; and in them I have been glorified. 11. I will no longer be in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, protect them by Your name, the name You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one. 12. While I was with them, I protected and preserved them by Your name, the name You gave Me. Not one of them has been lost, except the son of destruction, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. 13. But now I am coming to You; and I am saying these things while I am in the world, so that they may have My joy fulfilled within them. 14. I have given them Your word and the world has hated them; for they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 15. I am not asking that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them from the evil one. 16. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 17. Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth. 18. As You sent Me into the world, I have also sent them into the world. 19. For them I sanctify Myself, so that they too may be sanctified by the truth. 20. I am not asking on behalf of them alone, but also on behalf of those who will believe in Me through their message, 21. that all of them may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I am in You. May they also be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me. 22. I have given them the glory You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one— 23. I in them and You in Me—that they may be perfectly united, so that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me. 24. Father, I want those You have given Me to be with Me where I am, that they may see the glory You gave Me because You loved Me before the foundation of the world. 25. Righteous Father, although the world has not known You, I know You, and they know that You sent Me. 26. And I have made Your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love You have for Me may be in them, and I in them.”",
    "1. After Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where they entered a garden. 2. Now Judas His betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples. 3. So Judas brought a band of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They arrived at the garden carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons. 4. Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon Him, stepped forward and asked them, “Whom are you seeking?” 5. “Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. Jesus said, “I am He.” And Judas His betrayer was standing there with them. 6. When Jesus said, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground. 7. So He asked them again, “Whom are you seeking?” “Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. 8. “I told you that I am He,” Jesus replied. “So if you are looking for Me, let these men go.” 9. This was to fulfill the word He had spoken: “I have not lost one of those You have given Me.” 10. Then Simon Peter drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. 11. “Put your sword back in its sheath!” Jesus said to Peter. “Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?” 12. Then the band of soldiers, with its commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him. 13. They brought Him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 14. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be better if one man died for the people. 15. Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he also went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. 16. But Peter stood outside at the door. Then the disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in. 17. At this, the servant girl watching the door said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?” “I am not,” he answered. 18. Because it was cold, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made to keep warm. And Peter was also standing with them, warming himself. 19. Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching. 20. “I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus answered. “I always taught in the synagogues and at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. 21. Why are you asking Me? Ask those who heard My message. Surely they know what I said.” 22. When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Him in the face and said, “Is this how You answer the high priest?” 23. Jesus replied, “If I said something wrong, testify as to what was wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why did you strike Me?” 24. Then Annas sent Him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. 25. Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself. So they asked him, “Aren’t you also one of His disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.” 26. One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Didn’t I see you with Him in the garden?” 27. Peter denied it once more, and immediately a rooster crowed. 28. Then they led Jesus away from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. By now it was early morning, and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium, to avoid being defiled and unable to eat the Passover. 29. So Pilate went out to them and asked, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?” 30. “If He were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed Him over to you.” 31. “You take Him and judge Him by your own law,” Pilate told them. “We are not permitted to execute anyone,” the Jews replied. 32. This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to indicate the kind of death He was going to die. 33. Pilate went back into the Praetorium, summoned Jesus, and asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” 34. “Are you saying this on your own,” Jesus asked, “or did others tell you about Me?” 35. “Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your own people and chief priests handed You over to me. What have You done?” 36. Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world; if it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is not of this realm.” 37. “Then You are a king!” Pilate said. “You say that I am a king,” Jesus answered. “For this reason I was born and have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to My voice.” 38. “What is truth?” Pilate asked. And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against Him. 39. But it is your custom that I release to you one prisoner at the Passover. So then, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” 40. “Not this man,” they shouted, “but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was an insurrectionist.)",
    "1. Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him flogged. 2. The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, set it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe. 3. And they went up to Him again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him in the face. 4. Once again Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing Him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against Him.” 5. When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!” 6. As soon as the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” “You take Him and crucify Him,” Pilate replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against Him.” 7. “We have a law,” answered the Jews, “and according to that law He must die, because He declared Himself to be the Son of God.” 8. When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid, 9. and he went back into the Praetorium. “Where are You from?” he asked. But Jesus gave no answer. 10. So Pilate said to Him, “Do You refuse to speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and authority to crucify You?” 11. Jesus answered, “You would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of greater sin.” 12. From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.” 13. When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Stone Pavement, which in Hebrew is Gabbatha. 14. It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your King!” 15. At this, they shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!” “Shall I crucify your King?” Pilate asked. “We have no king but Caesar,” replied the chief priests. 16. Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified, and the soldiers took Him away. 17. Carrying His own cross, He went out to The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. 18. There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle. 19. Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 20. Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. 21. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’” 22. Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” 23. When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided His garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. 24. So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture: So that is what the soldiers did. 25. Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene. 26. When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, here is your son.” 27. Then He said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home. 28. After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” 29. A jar of sour wine was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth. 30. When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished.” And bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit. 31. It was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed. 32. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and those of the other. 33. But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 34. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out. 35. The one who saw it has testified to this, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. 36. Now these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of His bones will be broken.” 37. And, as another Scripture says: “They will look on the One they have pierced.” 38. Afterward, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he came and removed His body. 39. Nicodemus, who had previously come to Jesus at night, also brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. 40. So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. 41. Now there was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 42. And because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus there.",
    "1. Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. 2. So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,” she said, “and we do not know where they have put Him!” 3. Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb. 4. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 5. He bent down and looked in at the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. 6. Simon Peter arrived just after him. He entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there. 7. The cloth that had been around Jesus’ head was rolled up, lying separate from the linen cloths. 8. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in. And he saw and believed. 9. For they still did not understand from the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead. 10. Then the disciples returned to their homes. 11. But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent down to look into the tomb, 12. and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet. 13. “Woman, why are you weeping?” they asked. “Because they have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I do not know where they have put Him.” 14. When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there; but she did not recognize that it was Jesus. 15. “Woman, why are you weeping?” Jesus asked. “Whom are you seeking?” Thinking He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have put Him, and I will get Him.” 16. Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”). 17. “Do not cling to Me,” Jesus said, “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go and tell My brothers, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.’” 18. Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what He had said to her. 19. It was the first day of the week, and that very evening, while the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them. “Peace be with you!” He said to them. 20. After He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 21. Again Jesus said to them, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, so also I am sending you.” 22. When He had said this, He breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. 23. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.” 24. Now Thomas called Didymus, one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. 25. So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he replied, “Unless I see the nail marks in His hands, and put my finger where the nails have been, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe.” 26. Eight days later, His disciples were once again inside with the doors locked, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” 27. Then Jesus said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and look at My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe.” 28. Thomas replied, “My Lord and my God!” 29. Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” 30. Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book. 31. But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.",
    "1. Later, by the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus again revealed Himself to the disciples. He made Himself known in this way: 2. Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. 3. Simon Peter told them, “I am going fishing.” “We will go with you,” they said. So they went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night. 4. Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus. 5. So He called out to them, “Children, do you have any fish?” “No,” they answered. 6. He told them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it there, and they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish. 7. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it) and jumped into the sea. 8. The other disciples came ashore in the boat. They dragged in the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards. 9. When they landed, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it, and some bread. 10. Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.” 11. So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many, the net was not torn. 12. “Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said to them. None of the disciples dared to ask Him, “Who are You?” They knew it was the Lord. 13. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and He did the same with the fish. 14. This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after He was raised from the dead. 15. When they had finished eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love Me more than these?” “Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.” Jesus replied, “Feed My lambs.” 16. Jesus asked a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” “Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd My sheep.” 17. Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time, “Do you love Me?” “Lord, You know all things,” he replied. “You know I love You.” Jesus said to him, “Feed My sheep. 18. Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.” 19. Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. And after He had said this, He told him, “Follow Me.” 20. Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. He was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper to ask, “Lord, who is going to betray You?” 21. When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?” 22. Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow Me!” 23. Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?” 24. This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who has written them down. And we know that his testimony is true. 25. There are many more things that Jesus did. If all of them were written down, I suppose that not even the world itself would have space for the books that would be written."
